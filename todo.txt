verses with notes

VerseRange
--> all rsbNotes in range
--> first verse to which the note applies.  not necessarily rsbNote.verseRange.start

notes and first verse for note:
Seq[(RsbNote, SingleVerse)]

for each verse, all the RsbNotes for which the verse is first
--> Seq[(SingleVerse, Seq[RsbNote])]

we want this in the end
--> Seq[(Seq[SingleVerse], Seq[RsbNote])]




--> all SingleVerses in the range
  --> NivVerse for each SingleVerses
  --> RsbNotes for each verse.  don't include a note with a verse if it's already present for anothre verse

this works so we don't need to know how many chapters or verse each book has:
