To do
-----

- add # of verses in each chapter to Book
  - Parse NIV.json
- add NIV name


- handle note "Ps 1"


  - json
    - a file for each book
    - a file is an array of RsbNotes
    - to generate json files

      for each book
        open chunk id file
        for each chuck id
          get the note
            https://www.biblegateway.com/exbib/?pub=reformation-study-bible&chunk=187307
            parse into a RsbNoteWeb
            map RsbNoteWeb --> RsbNote
        write List[RsbNote] as json to the file: ruth_notes.json



    - location: could be
      1 verse
      verse range
      multiple individual verses.  Matt 2:3,5,8
    - html text
    - chunk id
  - operations
    - for a given verse range, maps each verse in that range to a set of notes

- Book should replace Book.  The name matching stuff would have to move.
Book was going to be serializable though...

- get all reformation study bible data
  - get json from a web url
  - get chunk ids for the notes for every book:
    https://www.biblegateway.com/exbib/contents/?osis=Ruth.1.1-Ruth.100.100
  - get the notes for all chunk ids

jsonb

https://www.biblegateway.com/exbib is the biblegateway rest api

rsb note in json:
https://www.biblegateway.com/exbib/?pub=reformation-study-bible&chunk=187165
https://www.biblegateway.com/exbib/contents/?osis=Ruth.2.7
https://www.biblegateway.com/exbib/contents/?osis=Ruth.1.1-Ruth.4.22 -->
	  {
	    "title": "Ruth 4:18\u201322",
	    "permalink": "Ruth.4.18-Ruth.4.22",
	    "id": "187307"
	  }

https://www.biblegateway.com/exbib/?pub=reformation-study-bible&chunk=187307


this works so we don't need to know how many chapters or verse each book has:
  https://www.biblegateway.com/exbib/contents/?osis=Ruth.1.1-Ruth.100.100


9/15

  - May need more naming info in Book
    {
      oneYearBibleName: "1corinthians",
      bibleGatewayName: "1 Corinthians",
      exbibName: "1Cor",
      nivJsonName: "1 Corinthians"
    },
    {
      oneYearBibleName: "song",
      bibleGatewayName: "Song of Songs",
      exbibName: "Song",
      nivJsonName: "Song of Solomon"
    }
