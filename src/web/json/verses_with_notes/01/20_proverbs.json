The first saying sees wisdom as a most precious acquisition (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Prov 4:1-Prov 4:9\">vv. 1–9</a>), the second as the path to true life (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Prov 4:10-Prov 4:19\">vv. 10–19</a>), and the third as the way of uprightness (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Prov 4:20-Prov 4:27\">vv. 20–27</a>). There is no direct reference to religion.</p><p>Wisdom traditions are shared by peoples of different cultures and religions. See notes <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Prov 22:17-Prov 24:22\">22:17–24:22</a>. Solomon discussed wisdom with people from other nations (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Kgs 4:29-1Kgs 4:34\">1 Kin. 4:29–34</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Kgs 10:1-1Kgs 10:7\">10:1–7</a>), showing how certain features of wisdom were shared across national and religious boundaries. In Israel, the insights of empirical wisdom were used in the framework of the covenant relationship and cannot be separated from special revelation (1:7 and notes).</p></div>"
