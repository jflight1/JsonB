This argument is rooted in the view that supernatural predictive prophecy is impossible. But in fact, this covenant curse is couched in more general terms than would apply to the Babylonian exile. It threatens a widespread dispersion “from one end of the earth to the other.” It may find fulfillment in the Assyrian and Babylonian exiles, as well as in the dispersion of the Jews after the fall of Jerusalem in <span class=\"small-caps\">a.d.</span> 70.</p></div>"
