The shocking violence and terrible destruction in these chapters trouble many readers. Yet the text seems to ring with praise to God. This is so because the destruction is the true and just judgment of God on sinners (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 15:16\">Gen. 15:16</a>; cf. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 18:24-Lev 18:27\">Lev. 18:24–27</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Deut 9:4\">Deut. 9:4</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Deut 9:5\">5</a>), through which He fulfilled His gracious promises to Israel (note the connection between salvation and judgment in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 14:13\">Ex. 14:13</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 14:14\">14</a> and <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 19:1\">Rev. 19:1</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 19:2\">2</a>). These accounts of destruction, no less than anything else in the book, testify to God’s faithfulness to His promises (cf. the curse in the promise in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 12:3\">Gen. 12:3</a>) and prefigure His final judgment on those who reject His grace (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 25:46\">Matt. 25:46</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Heb 9:27\">Heb. 9:27</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Heb 10:26-Heb 10:31\">10:26–31</a>).</p></div>"
