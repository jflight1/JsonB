The shocking violence and terrible destruction in these chapters trouble many readers. Yet the text seems to ring with praise to God. This is so because the destruction is the true and just judgment of God on sinners (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 15:16\">Gen. 15:16</a>; cf. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 18:24-Lev 18:27\">Lev. 18:24–27</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Deut 9:4\">Deut. 9:4</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Deut 9:5\">5</a>), through which He fulfilled His gracious promises to Israel (note the connection between salvation and judgment in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 14:13\">Ex. 14:13</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 14:14\">14</a> and <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 19:1\">Rev. 19:1</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 19:2\">2</a>).
