Civil war between the tribes was the result. This final story in the conclusion of Judges blames the misery of Israel on the lack of a king (19:1; 21:25; cf. 17:6; 18:1). Benjamin was the tribe that sinned. Even more, it was the men of Gibeah, Saul’s hometown, that behaved like the people of Sodom. Saul’s action in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Sam 11:6-1Sam 11:8\">1 Sam. 11:6–8</a> is clearly parallel to the Levite’s desecration of his concubine (19:29 note). Finally, Judah, the tribe of David, was the Lord’s choice to be the leader against Benjamin (note the similarity of wording between 1:1–2 and 20:18). The Benjaminites had practically become Canaanites. No one was without fault, however. Each tribe was doing as it saw fit (21:25). The conclusion to be drawn is that a king was needed, a king from Judah and not Benjamin. David and not Saul would initially qualify. Yet, being a man, even David would prove unequal to the task, as later developments would show (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Sam 12:10\">2 Sam. 12:10</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Sam 12:11\">11</a>).

For the story it is crucial that she be remembered as the foreigner (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ruth 1:4\">1:4</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ruth 2:2\">2:2</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ruth 2:6\">6</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ruth 2:21\">21</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ruth 4:5\">4:5</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ruth 4:10\">10</a>; especially <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ruth 2:10\">2:10</a>). Also, the reader may be prompted to think of Ruth’s ancestor, Lot’s daughter, and the incestuous beginnings of the Moabite nation (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 19:30-Gen 19:38\">Gen. 19:30–38</a>). In both cases the problem is childlessness or lack of a male heir.</p><p><b>barley harvest.</b> Early calendars, like the Gezer Calendar from the tenth century <span class=\"small-caps\">b.c</span>., associated months with the agricultural cycle. Barley was the first of the cereals to be harvested, in April; wheat was the last. In later tradition the barley and wheat harvests came to be identified with the festivals of Passover and Pentecost. The season of harvest was a time of celebration, rejoicing together before God, and remembering the poor. The narrative development is tied to this scheme. The women return home at the barley harvest, a time of God’s favor and the beginning of fruitful restoration for Naomi.</p></div>"
