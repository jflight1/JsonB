First, he invites agreement from the people that his leadership has been blameless (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Sam 12:4\">vv. 4</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Sam 12:5\">5</a>). Second, he points out that in the past it was always the Lord who appointed leaders (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Sam 12:6\">v. 6</a>), and these proved fully adequate (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Sam 12:7\">vv. 7</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Sam 12:8\">8</a>). Third, he emphasizes that even when Israel “forgot the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> their God,” the Lord was gracious to them. Although He subjected them to enemy oppression (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Sam 12:9\">v. 9</a>), He heard their confessions of sin and cries for deliverance (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Sam 12:10\">v. 10</a>) and raised up judges, among them Samuel himself (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Sam 12:11\">v. 11</a>). Against this background of the sufficiency of the Lord’s provision, the people’s demand to have a human king, even though the Lord was their king (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Sam 12:12\">v. 12</a>), can be seen for what it is (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Sam 8:7\">8:7</a>). Nevertheless, kingship can succeed, if both king and people “fear the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> and serve him and obey his voice” (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Sam 8:14\">v. 14</a>).</p></div>"
