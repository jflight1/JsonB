The Greek verb translated “love” in Jesus’ question changes when the question is raised the third time (v. 17), and Peter’s answer has this second verb each time. Some have thought that there is a difference intended in the use of the two verbs. This is possible but not necessary, for two reasons. First, John interchanges these verbs elsewhere in His Gospel. Second, other differences of wording in this conversation do not seem to indicate a difference of purpose. For example, “Feed my lambs,” “Tend my sheep,” and “Feed my sheep” are equivalent.</p><p><b>Feed my lambs.</b> “My lambs” and “my sheep” correspond to “my church” (10:14, 26, 27; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 16:18\">Matt. 16:18</a>).
