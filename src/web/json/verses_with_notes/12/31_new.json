The central figure and the central blessing of the city is God Himself and the Lamb (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 21:22\">21:22</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 21:23\">23</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 22:1-Rev 22:5\">22:1–5</a>). The final revelation of God necessarily brings to a climax all earlier revelations.

It harmonizes with the creation of all things by Christ at the beginning (1:17; 4:11; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Col 1:15-Col 1:17\">Col. 1:15–17</a>) and the redemption of all things through Christ in the middle (5:9–14; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 11:36\">Rom. 11:36</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Col 1:18-Col 1:20\">Col. 1:18–20</a>). Because of the fluid character of the imagery, it is wise not to distinguish rigidly between the inhabitants of the city (the saints) and the city itself (saints together with the glorified creation).</p></div>"
