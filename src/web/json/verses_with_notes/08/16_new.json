Just as it would be impossible to take the Lord’s Supper and claim that it had no religious significance, so it is naive for the Corinthians to think they can participate in temple feasts without being involved in idolatry. Another point is that the unity “in the body of Christ” symbolized by taking the bread and wine excludes union with idols.
