The psalmist wrestles with two problems: death and the prosperity of the rich. The psalm is one of the most difficult to translate and interpret correctly. Few places in the Old Testament express so directly the hope for the resurrection of the dead. The full doctrine of the resurrection was not revealed until Jesus rose from the grave and ascended to the right hand of God.</p></div>"
