But that is not stated. Rather, the period of servitude was six years for every Hebrew slave and in the seventh year he went free.</p><p>Recalling the nation’s experience of servitude in Egypt (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Deut 15:15\">v. 15</a>), Israel was to be merciful to slaves. The slave in ancient Israel had rights (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 21:1-Exod 21:11\">Ex. 21:1–11</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 21:20\">20</a>), and the redemption provisions here are generous—the freed slave must be given something with which to start fresh (v. 13, 14; cf. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 12:35\">Ex. 12:35</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 12:36\">36</a>).

That provision probably refers to the special case of an impoverished servant whose ancestral property was gone and who therefore had nowhere to go if freed.
