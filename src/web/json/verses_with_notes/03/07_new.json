If the first coming of the Son of Man is characterized by suffering and humiliation (8:31 note), His future coming at the end will be an open declaration of His divine glory.

Then v. 27 would refer to the worldwide spread of the gospel that followed that event. The “angels” there would be the messengers of the gospel (<i>angelos</i> is the Greek word for “messenger,” either human or angelic). On this view, Jesus’ first reference to the end (His Second Coming) is not until v. 32 (“that day”).</p></div>"
