The basic idea is that God is perfect life, while the essence of uncleanness is death. Normal, healthy creatures were clean, but abnormal or unhealthy creatures, and particularly corpses, were unclean. Abnormalities that suggested or that could lead to death were marks of uncleanness. Life and death were not to be mixed, so the unclean was never to enter God’s presence. Ultimately, it is Christ, the great Mediator and High Priest, who triumphs over death and corruption on behalf of those who trust in Him (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 15:20-1Cor 15:28\">1 Cor. 15:20–28</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 15:50-1Cor 15:57\">50–57</a>).</p></div>"

Modern physicians recognize here the symptoms of various modern complaints, but we should remember that the biblical classification is based primarily on spiritual rather than hygienic or medical considerations. The key principle in identifying a skin disease as “unclean” was whether the skin seemed to be rotting away, suggesting the spiritual principle of death. Patchy complaints amounted to uncleanness (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 13:9\">vv. 9</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 13:10\">10</a>), but a complaint affecting the whole body did not (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 13:12\">vv. 12</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 13:13\">13</a>). Stable conditions were clean, but deteriorating ones were unclean (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 13:5-Lev 13:8\">vv. 5–8</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 13:18-Lev 13:37\">18–37</a>). Similar principles applied to the diagnosis of uncleanness in clothing: progressive mildews were unclean (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 13:47-Lev 13:52\">vv. 47–52</a>), but stable ones were clean (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 13:53-Lev 13:58\">vv. 53–58</a>). The close association of uncleanness with death is shown in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 13:45\">13:45</a>. The person afflicted with a serious skin disease behaved as a mourner (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 21:10\">21:10</a>). He was excluded from the camp, not to protect the health of Israel, but because God was in the camp and uncleanness (death) had to be separated from the presence of God (life). See <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Num 5:1-Num 5:4\">Num. 5:1–4</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Num 12:14-Num 12:15\">12:14–15</a>.</p></div>"
