The Old Testament uses a number of criteria for distinguishing true from false prophecy. These criteria focus on what the message was, how it was received, and who received it. (a) The preeminent criterion for true or false prophecy is the fulfillment of the prophet’s words (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Deut 18:21\">Deut. 18:21</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Deut 18:22\">22</a>). His message must not contradict earlier revelation (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Deut 13:1-Deut 13:5\">Deut. 13:1–5</a>). The message of a true prophet often ran against popular sentiment, and the prophets were persecuted because of their unpopular pronouncements (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Jer 20:7-Jer 20:10\">Jer. 20:7–10</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Jer 38:1-Jer 38:13\">38:1–13</a>; cf. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 23:34\">Matt. 23:34</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 23:35\">35</a>). (b) Certain means of discerning God’s will were forbidden (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Deut 18:9-Deut 18:14\">Deut. 18:9–14</a>), such as divination, spiritism, and sorcery. However, prophets could receive revelation through dreams and visions (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Num 12:6-Num 12:8\">Num. 12:6–8</a>). (c) The true prophet was admitted to God’s confidence (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Jer 23:18\">Jer. 23:18</a>). The experience of admission to God’s counsel as if to a divine assembly was often reported in a call narrative (1:4–3:15 note). Finally, the prophet’s character had to be consistent with the glory of the God he served.</p></div>"

In this section, idolaters without any intention of giving up their idolatry come to seek a prophetic word. By God’s arrangement they find a prophet as false as they are, and both will come under God’s judgment. The prophet who serves them, though induced by God, must bear the responsibility for his wrongdoing.
