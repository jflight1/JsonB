Ezekiel weaves together the familiar understanding of Jerusalem as the city where God had chosen to dwell with references to Mount Sinai and the Garden of Eden.</p><p>An angel leads the prophet on a tour of the city, beginning at the gates to the outer court of the temple (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ezek 40:6-Ezek 40:27\">40:6–27</a>) and ending after several chapters with a division of land among the twelve tribes (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ezek 47:13-Ezek 48:35\">47:13–48:35</a>).
