Ezekiel weaves together the familiar understanding of Jerusalem as the city where God had chosen to dwell with references to Mount Sinai and the Garden of Eden.</p><p>An angel leads the prophet on a tour of the city, beginning at the gates to the outer court of the temple (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ezek 40:6-Ezek 40:27\">40:6–27</a>) and ending after several chapters with a division of land among the twelve tribes (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ezek 47:13-Ezek 48:35\">47:13–48:35</a>). Interpretations of these chapters vary widely. Many have seen in these passages a blueprint and building specifications for a normal city that was to be built (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ezek 43:10\">43:10</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ezek 43:11\">11</a>). However, elements of the prophetic vision seem to go beyond a literal understanding (e.g., <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ezek 47:1-Ezek 47:12\">47:1–12</a>). Other interpreters understand Ezekiel’s temple vision as a largely symbolic description of the way God would bless His people, with the temple preeminently standing for the presence of God in the midst of His people. Through the use of vision and symbol (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ezek 40:2\">40:2</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Num 12:6\">Num. 12:6</a>), the prophet describes a point in the future when the presence of God among His people would transcend anything Israel had experienced in history.</p></div>"

In Solomon’s temple there was a much larger Sea (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Kgs 7:23-1Kgs 7:26\">1 Kin. 7:23–26</a>). This Sea too was used for ritual washing (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Chr 4:6\">2 Chr. 4:6</a>), but in addition it symbolized the primeval ocean, no longer as a menacing symbol of chaos (28:2 note), but subjected by God to the service of His temple. In Ezekiel’s temple vision, these earlier basins are replaced by a life-giving river (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 21:1\">Rev. 21:1</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 22:1\">22:1</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 22:2\">2</a>). The tabernacle laver and the temple Sea stood south of the altar in the sanctuary courtyard; the river too originates from south of the altar. This passage should be compared with others that speak of a river in the city of God (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ps 46:4\">Ps. 46:4</a>), or describe the eruption of a stream in the city (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Joel 3:18\">Joel 3:18</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Zech 14:3-Zech 14:8\">Zech. 14:3–8</a>).

Each tribe is allotted a horizontal strip of land connecting with the eastern and western borders. The status of Jacob’s wives and of the individual tribes seem to be the determining factors in the arrangement of the tribes; cf. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Num 2\">Num. 2</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Num 3\">3</a>. The northernmost tribes (Dan, Asher, and Naphtali) were traditionally located in the north; the southernmost tribe (Gad, v. 27) was historically a northern tribe. These four tribes are the sons of Leah’s servant Zilpah and Rachel’s servant Bilhah (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 30:3-Gen 30:8\">Gen. 30:3–8</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 30:10-Gen 30:13\">10–13</a>); as such they are located at the outer extremities of the tribal allotments in Ezekiel’s vision.</p><p>Judah is the closest tribe north of the sacred area in the center of the land (vv. 8–22; 45:1–8). Judah was historically a southern tribe; by presenting the tribe of David as part of the northern tribes, Ezekiel may be saying in effect that the North will have a portion in David (cf. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Sam 20:1\">2 Sam. 20:1</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Kgs 12:16\">1 Kin. 12:16</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Chr 10:16\">2 Chr. 10:16</a>). Judah is in the place of honor that would have belonged to the firstborn Reuben; Reuben is immediately north of Judah. Next are the two tribes of Joseph, Ephraim and Manasseh, descendants of Jacob through the favored wife Rachel.</p><p>The nearest tribe south of the sacred area is Benjamin. Its favored place reflects the favored status of Rachel and balances the favored position of the Joseph tribes in the north. The remaining three southern tribes (Simeon, Issachar, and Zebulun) are the descendants of Leah; Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin historically held allotments in the north.</p></div>"

John too describes the city of God, and a time when God will live with human beings (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 21:3\">Rev. 21:3</a>); he ends with the prayer, “Amen. Come, Lord Jesus” (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 22:20\">Rev. 22:20</a>).</p></div>"
