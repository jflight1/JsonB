The dates in the Book of Ezekiel are normally calculated from the year of the captivity of Jehoiachin (cf. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ezek 40:1\">40:1</a>). But the first date in the book specifies a “thirtieth” year (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ezek 40:1\">v. 1</a>) and immediately refers to the “fifth year” (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ezek 40:2\">v. 2</a>) of Jehoiachin. Probably the “thirtieth” year is Ezekiel’s age at the time of his prophetic call, coinciding with the “fifth” year of Jehoiachin. A candidate for the priesthood ordinarily assumed the full responsibilities of the office at age thirty (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Num 4:3\">Num. 4:3</a>). Instead of achieving this important goal, Ezekiel was living in exile far from the temple in Jerusalem, unable to fulfill his calling as a priest.</p><p><b>Chebar canal.</b> The Jews living outside their homeland commonly established places of worship along streams of water (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ps 137:1\">Ps. 137:1</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Acts 16:13\">Acts 16:13</a>).
