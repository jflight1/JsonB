David is a model monarch for the generation returning from exile in Babylon. The books of Chronicles acknowledge that David had faults (13:7–11; 21:1–7), but did not record the major failures and troubles recorded in Samuel (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Sam 11:1-2Sam 21:14\">2 Sam. 11:1–21:14</a>). The account of David’s reign focuses on two major concerns: David’s great popularity (chs. 11–12) and his preparations for the temple (chs. 13–29). The section is arranged primarily by topic rather than chronology. The enthusiastic support for David from all over Israel should be an encouragement and model for the returned exiles.</p></div>"
