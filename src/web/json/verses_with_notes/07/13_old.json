Later readers experienced similar blessings in their return to the land. David invites the people to cry out for further protection and deliverance (v. 35). Those returned from Babylon needed the same help from God. Finally, the people responded with praise and joy at the blessings of God (v. 36), just as the later readers should praise God in their day.</p></div>"
