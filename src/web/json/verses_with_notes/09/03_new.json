To join with them would distort all life and ministry in the church. The prohibition against being yoked together with unbelievers must be considered in situations where significant control over one’s actions would be willingly yielded to an unbeliever through a voluntary partnership or association. Neither Paul nor the rest of the New Testament tells us to have no association at all with unbelievers (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Mark 2:15-Mark 2:17\">Mark 2:15–17</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 5:9\">1 Cor. 5:9</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 5:10\">10</a>).
