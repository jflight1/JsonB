It means a young woman of marriageable age, normally a virgin (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 24:43\">Gen. 24:43</a>). The Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Old Testament made about 150 <span class=\"small-caps\">b.c.</span>) translated with a word more specifically meaning “virgin.” The New Testament understands Isaiah to be designating the Virgin Mary (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 1:23\">Matt. 1:23</a>). See “The Virgin Birth of Jesus” at <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Luke 1:27\">Luke 1:27</a>.</p><p><b>Immanuel.</b> “God with us.” The name conveys God’s promise to save, bless, and protect His children. The identity of the virgin and the child has been the subject of considerable discussion. Three major views have been proposed. First, some, especially Jews of the second century <span class=\"small-caps\">a.d.</span>, understood the prophecy to mean Ahaz’s wife and her child, Hezekiah (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Kgs 18:2\">2 Kin. 18:2</a>). But as Jerome (c. 400 <span class=\"small-caps\">a.d.</span>) pointed out, Hezekiah was already born. Second, others identify the woman as Isaiah’s wife or a woman betrothed to him (8:3). The child is then Isaiah’s son, Maher-shalal-hashbaz. This interpretation is questionable. The Hebrew term translated “virgin” would not normally be used for a woman who was already a mother (of Shear-jashub, 7:3). If someone engaged to the prophet is meant, it becomes necessary to assume that his first wife had died. Also, the interpretation requires that the child have contradictory names: “God Is With Us” (Immanuel) and “The Spoil Speeds, the Prey Hastens” (Maher-shalal-hash-baz). Though not impossible, it seems unlikely. Finally, the child’s diet of “curds and honey” suggests that He would grow up after Judah’s destruction (v. 15 note). Tradition suggests a third interpretation, identifying the child as the Messiah, a divine personage whose birth is above nature. It equates the Child named “Immanuel” with the Child possessing God’s titles in 9:6, and with the “Branch” of ch. 11. According to Matthew, the virgin is Mary and the Child is Jesus Christ (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 1:22\">Matt. 1:22</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 1:23\">23</a>). In v. 16, the birth seems nevertheless to be imminent. Perhaps the prophecy has a partial fulfillment in the birth of Isaiah’s son Maher-shalal-hash-baz (8:1–3), while the definitive fulfillment waits for the birth of Jesus Christ, who secures God’s throne forever.</p></div>"
