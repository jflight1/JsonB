Hello everybody! Here's my brand new webpage!

<div>
    <h2><b><em>Well</em></b>, don't you want to know who I am and what my interests are?</h2>
</div>

Hello, I am Laura! I am a freshman at Woodside High School in Woodside! I consider myself to be 1/4 emo, 1/4 vintage, 1/4 trendy, and 1/4 unique in my own way. I am musical as well! I play trumpet in my school's marching band. I love listening to music as well. I consider my music taste eclectic, but all types of rock music is my favorite genre! I love food from different cultures and travel. Hope you all enjoy my AMAZING, ARTSY page.
