Job’s words are clear, but from his perspective, who does he expect to help him? The prologue reveals that God was not Job’s enemy. Indeed, God will become his vindicator (42:7). Job seems to be thinking of the Redeemer as a third party (16:19–21).</p><p><b>at the last he will stand upon the earth.</b> In Job’s mind this Vindicator will be both heavenly (16:19) and earthly (able to stand on the earth).</p></div>"

Since the book does touch on the idea of resurrection in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Job 14\">ch. 14</a>, it seems likely that when death is spoken of in v. 26, resurrection is in mind here, and the translation should be “in” my flesh. What is certain is that Job believes he has a Redeemer who loves him and for whom his heart yearns (v. 27). The whole passage is strongly evocative of every sinner’s need for the one Mediator who is both God and man (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Tim 2:5\">1 Tim. 2:5</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Tim 2:6\">6</a>).</p></div>"
