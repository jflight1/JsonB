The psalm uses themes that were current in the religions of the surrounding nations: the power behind storms (vv. 3–9) and the victor over floodwaters (vv. 10, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ps 29:11\">11</a>). The psalmist attacks these religions by taking the praises they claimed for their false gods and ascribing them to the Lord. The picture of God as King, enthroned over the vanquished floodwaters, is one of many indications that the psalm was used to celebrate a divinely given victory in battle.</p></div>"
