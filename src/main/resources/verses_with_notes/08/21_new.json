Accordingly, many argue that Paul is dealing with something different—a kind of ecstatic speech used for intimate prayer (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 8:26\">Rom. 8:26</a>). However, the word translated “tongue” is the normal Greek term for “language.” Secondly, Paul’s use of the term “mysteries” is to indicate a divine truth not yet disclosed; it does not have the meaning of the English word “mysterious” (2:7 note). Thirdly, vv. 10, 11, as well as v. 21, support the idea that even here Paul is speaking of human languages (12:8–10 note).</p><p><b>in the Spirit.</b> That is, as opposed to speaking with his mind (vv. 13–15); even the speaker does not understand what he is saying.</p></div>"
