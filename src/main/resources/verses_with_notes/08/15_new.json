The witness of the New Testament and of Paul in particular is that those whom God has brought to Himself are His forever (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 8:28-Rom 8:30\">Rom. 8:28–30</a>) because the life they have been given is eternal in character (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=John 5:24\">John 5:24</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Heb 7:16\">Heb. 7:16</a>). What God has begun He will bring to completion (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Phil 1:6\">Phil. 1:6</a>). However, it would be wrong to dismiss or minimize Paul’s concern (cf. 15:2; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Phil 3:11\">Phil. 3:11</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Col 1:23\">Col. 1:23</a>) by suggesting that it is merely hypothetical or relates only to rewards and not salvation. Paul was confident that absolutely nothing would be able to separate him from God’s love (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 8:38-Rom 8:39\">Rom. 8:38–39</a>), but he never presumed that he was saved regardless of what he did.
