The witness of the New Testament and of Paul in particular is that those whom God has brought to Himself are His forever (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 8:28-Rom 8:30\">Rom. 8:28–30</a>) because the life they have been given is eternal in character (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=John 5:24\">John 5:24</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Heb 7:16\">Heb. 7:16</a>).

Paul was confident that absolutely nothing would be able to separate him from God’s love (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 8:38-Rom 8:39\">Rom. 8:38–39</a>), but he never presumed that he was saved regardless of what he did. No Christian can afford to take lightly the warnings of Scripture (10:12).</p></div>"
