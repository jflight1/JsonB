Paul often uses it to identify the Christians to whom he writes (e.g., <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 1:7\">Rom. 1:7</a>). The description “sanctified” underlines this aspect of Christian life. The Corinthians were plagued by ethical problems and this letter touches repeatedly on the subject of sanctification. At the very beginning Paul calls special attention to it. Significantly, however, he encourages them in a pastoral way by reminding them that they <i>are</i> sanctified (6:11). The goal of holiness is realistic because God has already changed their hearts (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 6:1-Rom 6:14\">Rom. 6:1–14</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gal 5:24\">Gal. 5:24</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gal 5:25\">25</a>).</p></div>"
