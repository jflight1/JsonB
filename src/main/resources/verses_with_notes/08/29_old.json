This chapter is based on an important theme in the legal procedure of Job’s day. He appeals to God with an oath in the divine name and with a call for divine sanctions if he is lying. Although this is a protestation of innocence, it is not the self-righteousness of the Pharisee in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Luke 18:11\">Luke 18:11</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Luke 18:12\">12</a>.

Elihu’s critique centers on Job’s words uttered during the dispute. He quotes Job, but does not accuse him of having lived a wicked life. He stresses an issue neglected by the three friends: the disciplinary and redemptive role of suffering. Eliphaz alone had touched suffering as discipline (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Job 5:17\">5:17</a>).
