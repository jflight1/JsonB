But what about unbelievers who hear the tongues? The Corinthians have ignored them, and Paul admonishes the church for this display of spiritual immaturity. He appeals to “the Law,” (the Old Testament) to show that God uses unintelligible speech as a sign of judgment. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 28:11\">Is. 28:11</a> explains how God judged the Israelites through Assyrians speaking a foreign language. If non-Christians come to the worship and hear an unintelligible language, they will be repelled (v. 23) and reject the gospel. In this situation uninterpreted tongues are a sign of judgment “for unbelievers” (v. 22). But the Corinthians should aim at bringing unbelievers to repentance and to the recognition that God is present (v. 25). Because God uses the understandable words of prophecy to accomplish this purpose, prophecy is a sign “for believers”; it is evidence of God’s goodness to them (v. 22).</p></div>"

Since he had emphasized the importance of prophecy, he points out that even this gift should be exercised in an orderly fashion—“Let two or three prophets speak” (during the course of, or perhaps at various points in, the service), while “the others” who have the gift of prophecy should evaluate the message to ascertain that it is not false. Apparently the Corinthians were speaking in tongues and prophesying without regard for each other or for the content of the message (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 12:2\">12:2</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 12:3\">3</a> note).

In view of <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 11:5\">11:5</a> and other New Testament passages, it is certain that Paul is not absolutely forbidding women to speak in every church situation. Paul may have been addressing a particular problem in Corinth, such as women creating disorder during the worship service. He may have in mind a specific function, such as the evaluation of prophecy (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 11:29\">vv. 29</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 11:32\">32</a>), in which women should not participate.
