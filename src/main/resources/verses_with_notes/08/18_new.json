Phrases such as “in an unworthy manner” (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 11:27\">v. 27</a>) and “Let a person examine himself” (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 11:28\">v. 28</a>) can be extended and applied to many circumstances, but we should be careful not to wrench them from their context. In particular, it would be a misreading of <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 11:30\">v. 30</a> to think that God routinely brings illness and death to Christians who, in spite of their spiritual failings, partake of the Supper. The problem in Corinth was much more specific and serious. Some of the Corinthians were tearing apart the unity of the Christian body represented by the one loaf (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 10:17\">10:17</a>). The warning in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 10:29\">v. 29</a> about “discerning the body” almost surely refers to this failure to maintain the unity of the church as the body of Christ (see <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 12:12\">12:12</a> note). Because some of the believers in Corinth were celebrating the Supper in a way that destroyed the unity it represents, God had brought judgment upon the community. God’s purpose in judging these believers, however, was to prevent them from being “condemned along with the world” (v. 32).</p></div>"
