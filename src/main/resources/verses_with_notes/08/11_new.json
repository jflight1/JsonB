The apostle had to be careful lest his teaching be distorted in one direction or another. Paul does not simply dismiss the slogan; he too opposes sexual immorality, and he recognizes a certain value in remaining unmarried (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 7:7\">vv. 7</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 7:8\">8</a>). He can give specific and valid reasons why a Christian may decide to stay single (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 7:29-1Cor 7:35\">vv. 29–35</a>). But he must correct those who demand celibacy. In different contexts, Paul will speak of marriage in only positive terms (e.g., <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Eph 5:22-Eph 5:33\">Eph. 5:22–33</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Tim 3:2\">1 Tim. 3:2</a>) and he condemns those who forbid marriage (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Tim 4:3\">1 Tim. 4:3</a>).</p></div>"

The Scripture gives no support whatever to the notion that sexual relations are solely at the direction and for the enjoyment of the husband. The apostle allows for temporary abstention from sex (in a way similar to fasting; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 7:5\">v. 5</a>), but he does not allow protracted abstinence. God requires sexual union as part of marriage.</p></div>"

There are certain advantages for the work of the kingdom in remaining unmarried, and so Paul personally can wish that every believer would give his or her life exclusively to the advance of the gospel. But the apostle realizes that such a situation is not possible for everyone and would only lead many Christians into sexual temptation. Moreover, there are other reasons why one should marry that are not relevant to the present discussion (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 7:1\">v. 1</a> note).</p></div>"
