The arrogance of human wisdom blinds unbelievers to the truth. Jesus thanked the Father for His good pleasure in hiding these things from the wise and learned but revealing them to little children (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 11:25\">Matt. 11:25</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 11:26\">26</a>).</p></div>"
