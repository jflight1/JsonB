It is also used in a broader sense (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 16:7\">Rom. 16:7</a>), while in general or nontechnical use it means a “messenger” or “representative” (8:23; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Phil 2:25\">Phil. 2:25</a>).</p><p><b>by the will of God.</b> It is God’s sovereign choice that ultimately places people in church offices and ministries. The apostolic office was extraordinary and temporary, and did not continue when there were no surviving eyewitnesses of the Resurrection, and when the canon of Scripture was complete. The ordinary offices continue to be necessary, and are filled by elders (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Acts 20:28\">Acts 20:28</a>) and others whose gifts equip them for ministries (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 12:7\">1 Cor. 12:7</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 12:11\">11</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 12:28\">28</a>). Calls to the ordinary offices are confirmed by the people of God as the church discerns who has received the gifts and qualifications for the work (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Eph 4:11\">Eph. 4:11</a>).</p><p><b>saints.</b> A term commonly used by Paul to refer to all Christians (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 15:25\">Rom. 15:25</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Phil 1:1\">Phil. 1:1</a>).</p><p><b>in the whole of Achaia.</b> Though the letter was intended primarily for the church at Corinth, Paul apparently realized that it would be read by neighboring churches in the region of Achaia, the southern part of modern Greece.
