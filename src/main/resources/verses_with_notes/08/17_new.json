The evidence from Greek literature is ambiguous, and the present context does not resolve the problem. The two ideas should probably not be regarded as excluding each other. In two other contexts where Paul speaks of Christ as head (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Eph 4:15\">Eph. 4:15</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Col 2:19\">Col. 2:19</a>), the notion of “source” may be present (cf. v. 8). Elsewhere Paul uses the metaphor with explicit reference to authority or submission (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Eph 1:22\">Eph. 1:22</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Eph 5:23\">5:23</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Eph 5:24\">24</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Col 1:18\">Col. 1:18</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Col 2:10\">2:10</a>). Here the stress probably falls on authority rather than source (cf. v. 10).</p></div>"

Some scholars think that Paul refers to a particular hairstyle (in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Num 5:18\">Num. 5:18</a>, loosening a woman’s hair is part of the test for an unfaithful wife). See note on v. 15.</p><p><b>the same as if her head were shaven.</b> In v. 6, shaving a woman’s head is compared to having the hair cut short, presumably like a man’s. It appears then that Paul is opposing a practice that tended to obliterate the distinction between the sexes. Possibly, the controversy reflects the idea of some Corinthians that they had achieved perfection and were no longer subject to the normal rules (Introduction: Date and Occasion).</p></div>"
