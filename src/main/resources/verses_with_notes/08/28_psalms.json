A number of early Hebrew manuscripts put them together, and a common refrain unites them (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ps 42:5\">42:5</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ps 42:11\">11</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ps 43:5\">43:5</a>). <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ps 43\">Ps. 43</a> is without a title in a part of the Psalter where almost every psalm is titled. The two psalms are a single lament in three parts, each concluding with the same refrain (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ps 42:1-Ps 42:5\">42:1–5</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ps 42:6-Ps 42:11\">6–11</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ps 43:5\">Ps. 43:5</a>). For some reason the psalmist is forced to be separated from Jerusalem, the place God has chosen to make His throne. His distance from the Lord and the presence of his enemies causes him to cry out to the Lord for help.</p></div>"
