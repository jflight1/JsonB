The items in this verse are different from those in vv. 8–10—confirmation that Paul is not interested in giving a complete list. Here Paul begins with “apostles” and “prophets,” whom he considers the foundation (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Eph 2:20\">Eph. 2:20</a>), and adds as a third category “teachers,” so that this listing is similar to that in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Eph 4:11\">Eph. 4:11</a>. Though the Greek words for “helping” and “administrating” do not occur elsewhere in the New Testament, Paul probably has in mind the gifts of one who “does acts of mercy” or “leads” (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 12:8\">Rom. 12:8</a>).</p></div>"

In comparison with what we will receive then, the present blessings are only partial and thus imperfect. It is therefore a sign of immaturity for the Corinthians to treat the temporary, incomplete gifts of the Spirit as having ultimate significance. According to another view, Paul may be referring to the “complete” revelation contained in the New Testament Scriptures, which make prophecy and other revelatory gifts obsolete. Still other interpretations have been suggested, such as the maturity in love that the Corinthians should aim for, the maturing of the early church, or the death of the individual Christian.</p></div>"
