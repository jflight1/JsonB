The discovery in ancient texts (including one dated about 485 <span class=\"small-caps\">b.c.</span>) of the Babylonian personal name, Mardukaya, and the discovery of an archive of texts in Nippur containing the names of Jews from the time of Artaxerxes I and Darius, point to the authenticity of Mordecai’s name and to the historicity of the events behind the story.
