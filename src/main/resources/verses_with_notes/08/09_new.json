The apostle is commanding the church to expel the offender from their fellowship (“deliver this man to Satan”). The purpose of this judgment is the man’s salvation, but that can be achieved only if his sinful tendencies are overcome (“the destruction of the flesh”). According to one interpretation of <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Cor 2:5-2Cor 2:11\">2 Cor. 2:5–11</a>, this man did repent of his sin.
