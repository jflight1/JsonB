The next ten verses contain more than a dozen rhetorical questions that reflect Paul’s deep emotion and provide clues about the historical situation. Paul defends his right to be supported by the churches, only to emphasize his choice not to receive support (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 2:15-1Cor 2:16\">vv. 15–18</a>). Perhaps some of the Corinthians were upset because Paul refused their patronage, and concluded from this that he was not a legitimate apostle (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Cor 11:7-2Cor 11:12\">2 Cor. 11:7–12</a>).
