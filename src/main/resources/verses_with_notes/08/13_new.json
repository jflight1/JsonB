According to some interpreters, the issues discussed in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 8\">ch. 8</a> and in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 10:25-1Cor 10:30\">10:25–30</a> are one and the same.

These comments reveal that behind the behavior of the Corinthians (or at least an important group among them) lay a serious problem of attitude. Their conduct was not guided by love (cf. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 13\">ch. 13</a>) but by pride.</p></div>"
