It is important, however, to notice the connection. In the first place, the topic of immorality has not been abandoned, but will recur in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 6:9\">v. 9</a>. Secondly, the failings of the Corinthians with regard to lawsuits are an expression of the problem already discussed in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 5\">ch. 5</a>, namely, a weak doctrine of the church. Just as Christians are not responsible to regulate the lives of non-Christians, so non-Christians have no power to discipline in the church. If the Corinthians understood the relation between the Israelite community and the Christian fellowship (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 5:12\">5:12</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 5:13\">13</a> note), they would realize it was absurd for believers to go outside the church to solve their disputes. Who could imagine a pagan Gentile settling disputes among Israelites in the wilderness? This text does not comment on the legitimate role of civil authorities to judge matters that God has put under them. See “Christians and Civil Government” at <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 13:1\">Rom. 13:1</a>.</p></div>"

The point is certainly not that Christians should be encouraged to take abuse from others. After all, cheating and injustice should not even exist within the Christian community. That such injustices do exist, and are indeed performed by Christians against one another, demonstrates how far the Corinthians have fallen. Nevertheless, if the Corinthians understood the serious implications of all the improprieties in their church, and if they appreciated the qualities that should characterize believers (cf. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 13:4-1Cor 13:7\">13:4–7</a>), they would much sooner bear injustice than bring disgrace upon the Christian community by publicly exposing their misdeeds in the civil courts.</p></div>"

The question arises whether anyone at all can be saved, since all are wicked. Paul’s answer is twofold: on the one hand, God delights in justifying the wicked (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 4:5\">Rom. 4:5</a>); on the other hand, those whom God justifies (declares righteous because of Christ’s death) He also sanctifies (leads into a holy way of life; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 6:1-Rom 6:4\">Rom. 6:1–4</a>). Paul is confident that the Corinthians are true believers, justified and sanctified (v. 11 note), and that their present misbehavior is an anomaly that can be corrected. But it must be corrected. Persistence in wickedness would be an indication that their faith is false and that they have no place in the kingdom.</p></div>"
