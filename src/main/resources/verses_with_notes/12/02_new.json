The prediction of “the antichrist” is not from the Old Testament but from Jesus (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 24:5\">Matt. 24:5</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 24:24\">24</a>). This prediction began to be fulfilled in the New Testament era with those who denied the Father and the Son (v. 22) and left the church to propagate their false teaching (v. 19). Their denial of the Son was a rejection of the Father who sent Him (2:23; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=John 15:23\">John 15:23</a>). In contrast to the antichrists, believers have an anointing from the Holy Spirit (vv. 20, 27) that opens their hearts and minds to know the saving truth. The Spirit Himself is the best teacher; He will remain with us always and protect us from falsehoods that could lead us away from Christ. The Spirit abides wherever the message of the gospel is received, and wherever the Spirit abides, the Son and the Father are present as well (v. 24).</p></div>"
