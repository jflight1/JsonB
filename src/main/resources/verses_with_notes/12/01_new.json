His atonement is effective for the elect of Israel and of the whole world.</p><p>In the Bible, to “know” someone includes close communion and love. To know Christ means to “keep his commandments.” This knowledge of Christ is called a “perfected” love of God (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1John 1:5\">v. 5</a>), not because it makes us personally sinless, but because it is irrevocably established in those who live by it. Anyone who presumes to have received forgiveness from God but who spurns the gift of obedient love as unnecessary is a “liar.” Instead of receiving “Jesus Christ the righteous” as Savior, such a person manufactures a false christ, a savior who is indifferent to righteousness.</p></div>"
