Jesus was sinless, and what is more He came to take away sin (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1John 3:5\">v. 5</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=John 1:29\">John 1:29</a>). The New Birth sets a person irrevocably against sin, and because the seed of new life “abides” in that person (v. 9; cf. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=John 10:28\">John 10:28</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=John 10:29\">29</a>), the defeat of corruption and death for him is inevitable. In this sense sin will be impossible (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 6:8\">Rom. 6:8</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 6:9\">9</a>). John addresses this absolute aspect of being born again and speaks accordingly. He is not denying that sin and death have influence until the very end (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 15:26\">1 Cor. 15:26</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 20:14\">Rev. 20:14</a>). He says clearly that in this life no one can be without sin (1:8).</p></div>"

When the fellowship of believers is free from animosity, as John expects it will be, we know that we “have passed out of death into life” (v. 14).

It is based on the love of Jesus Christ, who “laid down his life” in our place. Measuring ourselves against such an example, our heart “condemns us” (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1John 3:20\">v. 20</a>), and our confidence can only be restored by someone greater than our hearts—God Himself. God, who “knows everything,” has proved His love for sinners by the gift of His Son (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1John 4:10\">4:10</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 5:8\">Rom. 5:8</a>). Confidence founded on this reality carries with it the assurance that our deeds are also accepted by God (v. 22), and when guilt is dealt with we are released to pray unhindered (v. 22). Confident prayer is a hallmark of the children of God (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=John 15:7\">John 15:7</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 8:15\">Rom. 8:15</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 8:16\">16</a>).</p></div>"
