This is unlikely, since John in his Gospel does not directly recount the baptism of Jesus. Others suggest that “water and blood” refers to the two sacraments, baptism and the Lord’s Supper. This is also unlikely, since John does not recount the institution of the sacraments in his Gospel. The difficult saying of this verse probably reflects <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=John 19:34\">John 19:34</a>. In John’s Gospel, the testimony God bears to Jesus His Son is a key theme. The blood and water that flowed from Jesus after His death attested to the reality of His death; the wound in Jesus’ side later confirmed the reality of His bodily resurrection (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=John 20:20\">John 20:20</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=John 20:25-John 20:27\">25–27</a>).
