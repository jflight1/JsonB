In contrast with Jonah, the Gentile sailors are careful to avoid personal sin before God (v. 14). The prophet of God is judged, but the Gentiles are spared, an event that foreshadows the response and sparing of the Ninevites in the book’s second division.</p></div>"

Despite his blatant disobedience and narrow-mindedness, Jonah understood the character of God.
