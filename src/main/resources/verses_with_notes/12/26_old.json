The first prophecy of the book’s latter half focuses on the coming of God the King in judgment. The opening verses (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Zech 9:1-Zech 9:8\">9:1–8</a>) portray God as an avenging warrior who comes to take possession of His land by destroying all the pagan enemies who lie in His path (cf. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 9:6\">Is. 9:6</a> note). He comes from the north to Jerusalem (cf. 9:14–17, where God is pictured as coming from the south to Jerusalem), an event that leads to the proclamation of 9:9. Some interpret the picture of a northern invasion as describing Alexander the Great’s conquest of Palestine in 333 <span class=\"small-caps\">b.c.</span> That may be, but its greater meaning concerns God Himself coming to avenge His people.
