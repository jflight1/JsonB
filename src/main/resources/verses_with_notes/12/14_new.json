He is surrounded by angelic courtiers (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Kgs 22:19\">1 Kin. 22:19</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Job 1:6\">Job 1:6</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Job 2:1\">2:1</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ps 89:6\">Ps. 89:6</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ps 89:7\">7</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ezek 1\">Ezek. 1</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Dan 7:9\">Dan. 7:9</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Dan 7:10\">10</a>). His rule was established in creation (4:11), is exercised in the panorama of history (6:1–22:5), is brought to fulfillment through the Lamb (ch. 5; 22:1) and is celebrated in songs of praise (1:6 note). Revelation is preeminently a book about God and His greatness. The secrets of history and of spiritual conflict center on God Himself. The whole universe is destined to be filled with the glory (21:22, 23) and goodness of God (22:1–5), and with His praise (5:13). Hence the pattern for the outcome of history is revealed in miniature here (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 6:10\">Matt. 6:10</a>).</p><p>When God’s people are beset by temptation or persecution, a revelation of God’s character and glory is the best remedy. His power guarantees the final victory, His justice guarantees vindication of the right, His goodness and magnificence guarantee blessing and comfort. The blood of the Lamb demonstrates that redemption has already been accomplished.</p></div>"

A second dramatic act within the vision is introduced in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 5:1\">5:1</a>. From creation in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 4:11\">4:11</a>, the action shifts to a focus on redemption and re-creation. God’s purposes of redemption and rule can be accomplished only through One who is uniquely worthy—Jesus Christ. He is simultaneously the fierce Lion of the tribe of Judah, warring against God’s enemies (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 17:14\">17:14</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 19:11-Rev 19:21\">19:11–21</a>), and the gentle Lamb that has been slain, who purchased His people with the blood of His atoning sacrifice (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 19:9\">vv. 9</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 19:10\">10</a>). Only God in His trinitarian fullness can accomplish these magnificent purposes. Note the presence of the Father (“him who was seated on the throne,” <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 19:1\">vv. 1</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 19:7\">7</a>), the Son (“Lamb,” <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 19:6\">vv. 6</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 19:7\">7</a>), and the Spirit of God (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 19:6\">v. 6</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 1:4\">1:4</a> note), who is the horns and eyes of the Lamb.</p><p>This chapter constitutes the opening scene for the first cycle of judgments that lead up to the Second Coming of Christ (Introduction: Outline). The Lamb and the sealed scroll are introduced. The opening of the seals in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 6:1-Rev 8:1\">6:1–8:1</a> sets in motion a series of judgments that have their origin in God’s throne and purpose, and that issue in His final manifestation as Judge.

The close parallel with <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Dan 12:4\">Dan. 12:4</a> makes it likely that the scroll is a heavenly book containing God’s plan and the destiny of the world. The unsealing of the book implies the accomplishment of the things God has purposed. John weeps (v. 4) because he longs for God’s purposes to be accomplished (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 6:10\">Matt. 6:10</a>), and it is hard to see how that can happen. However, through Christ’s decisive sacrifice a whole host is redeemed (v. 9), and the purposes of the Exodus and of man’s original dominion are finally fulfilled (v. 10).</p></div>"
