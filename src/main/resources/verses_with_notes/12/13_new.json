His rule was established in creation (4:11), is exercised in the panorama of history (6:1–22:5), is brought to fulfillment through the Lamb (ch. 5; 22:1) and is celebrated in songs of praise (1:6 note). Revelation is preeminently a book about God and His greatness. The secrets of history and of spiritual conflict center on God Himself. The whole universe is destined to be filled with the glory (21:22, 23) and goodness of God (22:1–5), and with His praise (5:13). Hence the pattern for the outcome of history is revealed in miniature here (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 6:10\">Matt. 6:10</a>).</p><p>When God’s people are beset by temptation or persecution, a revelation of God’s character and glory is the best remedy. His power guarantees the final victory, His justice guarantees vindication of the right, His goodness and magnificence guarantee blessing and comfort. The blood of the Lamb demonstrates that redemption has already been accomplished.</p></div>"

This imagery might suggest a number of associations. The parallel verse in 15:2 calls to mind the waters of the Red Sea. The defeat of Pharaoh and the pushing back of the waters foreshadowed God’s final victory over evil (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 51:9-Isa 51:11\">Is. 51:9–11</a>). If so, the sea of glass pictures waters subdued under God’s power. Moreover, the extent and beauty of the crystal-like sea, when taken together with the precious stones in v. 3 and 21:18–21, suggest the magnificence and preciousness of God’s throne. The numerous parallels elsewhere with the temple (4:2 note) might suggest that this sea is the heavenly counterpart of the sea in Solomon’s temple (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Kgs 7:23-1Kgs 7:25\">1 Kin. 7:23–25</a>).
