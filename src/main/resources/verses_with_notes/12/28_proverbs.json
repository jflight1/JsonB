Lemuel was not an Israelite king. The nature of this section (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Prov 30:1-Prov 30:9\">vv. 1–9</a>) suggests an Egyptian or perhaps a Babylonian origin. Its intention is apparently vocational, the equipping of the ruler for his task. The form is similar to the instructions of <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Prov 1-Prov 9\">chs. 1–9</a> (Introduction: Characteristics and Themes). In this case, the teaching is given by the mother (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Prov 1:8\">1:8</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Prov 4:1\">4:1</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Prov 4:3\">3</a>). While the father may have been the principal teacher of the children, godly women also took that role (cf. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Prov 14:1\">14:1</a> note), and there were in Israel noteworthy wise women (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Sam 14:2\">2 Sam. 14:2</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Sam 20:16\">20:16</a>).</p></div>"
