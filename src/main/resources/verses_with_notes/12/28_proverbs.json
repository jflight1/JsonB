While the father may have been the principal teacher of the children, godly women also took that role (cf. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Prov 14:1\">14:1</a> note), and there were in Israel noteworthy wise women (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Sam 14:2\">2 Sam. 14:2</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Sam 20:16\">20:16</a>).</p></div>"
