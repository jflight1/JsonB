The psalm describes the glories of Jerusalem, where God is worshiped and where the dynasty of David rules (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Sam 7\">2 Sam. 7</a>), asking God to protect the city and its inhabitants.</p><p>This psalm is similar to the “Zion” songs which extol the city of Jerusalem (46; 48; 76). Jerusalem was prized above other cities because God chose to reveal Himself there to His people. Since Christ has come, God’s people can meet Him in Christ anywhere on the face of the earth (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=John 4:19-John 4:23\">John 4:19–23</a>). Jerusalem represents all believers (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gal 4:26\">Gal. 4:26</a>), and it typifies the coming New Jerusalem (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 21:9-Rev 21:27\">Rev. 21:9–27</a>).</p></div>"
