Many proverbs show an interest in nature as a parable on human life (e.g., <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Prov 6:6-Prov 6:11\">6:6–11</a>). The fact that wisdom is ascribed to these creatures implies some unity with human existence. The creatures are wise because they are able to surmount some serious inherent weakness, and so to survive well. These gifts of wisdom, to each according to its kind, are given by the Creator of all.</p></div>"
