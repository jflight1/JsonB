The opening scene of worship (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 15:1-Rev 16:1\">15:1–16:1</a>) calls to mind the worship around God’s throne in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 4\">chs. 4</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 5\">5</a>. The overcomers rejoice in God’s presence (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 15:3\">15:3</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 15:4\">4</a>). Seven resplendent angels receive bowls from the presence of God in the temple. The bowls symbolize the cup of God’s wrath, which makes the nations drunk (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 14:10\">14:10</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 16:19\">16:19</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 51:17\">Is. 51:17</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 51:20\">20</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 51:22\">22</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Jer 25:15-Jer 25:29\">Jer. 25:15–29</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lam 4:21\">Lam. 4:21</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ezek 23:31-Ezek 23:34\">Ezek. 23:31–34</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Hab 2:16\">Hab. 2:16</a>). The bowls are poured out at God’s command (16:1), resulting in seven last plagues. The plagues lead up to the Second Coming, since “with them the wrath of God is finished” (15:1).</p><p>The seven bowls show notable similarities with the seven trumpets. The first four bowls, like the first four trumpets, result in devastation on the four major regions of creation: land, sea, fresh water, and sky. Like the trumpets, the bowls are reminiscent of the plagues against Egypt. But the bowls result in more severe judgments than did the trumpets. The trumpet judgments typically affected a third of the total, but the bowls affect the whole.</p><p>These bowls symbolize the judgments of God against evildoers. The general pattern may include both the judgments against the godless Roman Empire and the final crisis leading up to the Second Coming (Introduction: Interpretive Difficulties).</p></div>"

The imagery alludes to the battle between God and Pharaoh in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 15:2\">Ex. 15:2</a>, but the panorama is universal in scope. Several passages in Revelation describe the battle with increasing detail and precision (17:13, 14; 19:11–21; 20:7–10; cf. 6:12–17), all based on the eschatological battle of Gog and Magog in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ezek 38\">Ezek. 38</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ezek 39\">39</a>.

Like the other cycles, this one ends with the Second Coming (Introduction: Characteristics and Themes: Literary Form), though the symbols of the Second Coming are not as obvious as in some other cases. Note the following features: the readers have been told that the end of the wrath of God would come with the seventh bowl (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 15:1\">15:1</a>); the removal of all islands and mountains in v. 20 corresponds to the final shaking of the earth in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 6:14\">6:14</a> and <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 20:11\">20:11</a> (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Heb 12:26\">Heb. 12:26</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Heb 12:27\">27</a>); elsewhere the fall of Babylon is immediately followed by the marriage supper of the Lamb (19:1–10); in 17:14–17 the fall of Babylon is associated with the last battle, which takes place at the Second Coming (19:11–21). Moreover, that final battle was imminent in v. 16. The judgment of the seventh bowl continues the practice of drawing the imagery of the final battle from the conflict with Gog and Magog (v. 14 note) by grouping together an earthquake, the overturning of the mountains, and hail, as in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ezek 38:19-Ezek 38:23\">Ezek. 38:19–23</a>. Hence it describes the divine plague-judgments accompanying the battle; a description of other aspects of the battle is delayed until 19:11–21 in keeping with the dramatic plan of Revelation.</p></div>"
