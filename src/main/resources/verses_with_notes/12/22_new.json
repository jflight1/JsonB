    "text" : "<div class=\"article\"><p><b><a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 12-Rev 14\">12:1–14:20</a></b> This third cycle of visions consists primarily of histories of key symbolic characters: the dragon, the woman, the beast, the false prophet, the 144,000, angelic announcers, and the Son of Man (Introduction: Outline). Unlike the cycles of seven seals (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 5:1-Rev 8:1\">5:1–8:1</a>) and seven trumpets (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 8:2-Rev 11:19\">8:2–11:19</a>), these visions have no explicit numbering. But, like the preceding cycles, they lead to a vision of the Second Coming (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 14:14-Rev 14:20\">14:14–20</a>). The two preceding cycles focused on the judgments issuing from God’s throne. This cycle depicts in depth the nature of the spiritual conflict. Characters appear in symbolic form to represent the forces on the two sides of a cosmic spiritual war.</p><p>God Himself has already been revealed in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 4\">chs. 4</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 5\">5</a>. Opposing God are Satan (the dragon) and his agents, the beast (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 13:1-Rev 13:10\">13:1–10</a>) and the false prophet (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 13:11-Rev 13:18\">13:11–18</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 16:13\">16:13</a>). On God’s side are His people, portrayed as a light-bearing woman (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 12:1-Rev 12:6\">12:1–6</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 12:13-Rev 12:17\">13–17</a>) and as a chaste, numbered, and protected multitude (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 14:1-Rev 14:5\">14:1–5</a>). These two complementary pictures show the saints in their capacity as witnesses of God’s light and as separated from the corruptions of the world. Thus the saints are exhorted to remain faithful to Christ in response to the persecution by the beast, and to remain pure by resisting the seduction by the harlot (Introduction: Characteristics and Themes: Content). The symbolic pictures show the two sides stripped of all inconsistency and confusion to clearly express the nature of spiritual warfare (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Eph 6:10-Eph 6:20\">Eph. 6:10–20</a>). The present conflicts will be followed by the peace of 21:1–22:5 when the fulfillment of God’s plans takes effect.</p></div>"

This beast in Revelation must be a worldly kingdom summing up all of them. In this way the state persecutions of Daniel and his friends suggest the nature of the persecution that the seven churches must face from the Roman state—and possibly persecutions of later ages. Interpreters disagree about which particular persecution the beast most directly represents (Introduction: Interpretive Difficulties). In Asia Minor, local officials threatened to kill Christians if they refused to worship the Roman Emperor. A similar opposition to godly worship will crop up just before the Second Coming (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Thess 2:4\">2 Thess. 2:4</a>). Persecutions come sporadically in the period between these two times (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 24:9\">Matt. 24:9</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Tim 3:12\">2 Tim. 3:12</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Tim 3:13\">13</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Pet 4:12-1Pet 4:19\">1 Pet. 4:12–19</a>).

His actions counterfeit the witness of the Holy Spirit (see Introduction: Characteristics and Themes: Other Features). In first-century Asia Minor, the main propagandists would have been priests of the emperor cult and the “Commune of Asia,” a council of distinguished city representatives promoting loyalty to the emperor. In modern times as well, totalitarianism enlists propagandists.

The number then designates either Nero himself (who was to rise from the dead and lead an invasion against Rome according to a widespread belief during Domitian’s reign) or a later figure imitating Nero’s godlessness. Many have tried to identify the final Antichrist on the basis of the number, but its connections with Nero may well be its only significance (see text note).
