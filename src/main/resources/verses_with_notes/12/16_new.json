The participation of the Lamb reminds us that such judgments are based on His unique qualifications and accomplishments (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 5\">ch. 5</a>). In formal structure, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 5:1-Rev 8:1\">5:1–8:1</a> runs parallel to <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 8:2-Rev 11:19\">8:2–11:19</a>. Each has an opening scene introducing the origin of the judgments (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 5\">ch. 5</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 8:2-Rev 8:6\">8:2–6</a>). Six judgments follow (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 6\">ch. 6</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 8:7-Rev 9:21\">8:7–9:21</a>).

The seventh and climactic judgment follows the interlude (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 8:1\">8:1</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 11:15-Rev 11:19\">11:15–19</a>; Introduction: Outline). The seven judgments move forward toward the Second Coming, which occurs in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 6:12-Rev 6:17\">6:12–17</a> and <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 11:15-Rev 11:19\">11:15–19</a>. The first four of the seven judgments have an inner unity. The four living creatures of <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 4:6\">4:6</a> and the four horsemen of <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Zech 1:8\">Zech. 1:8</a> are reflected in 6:1–8. The four major regions of the world (dry land, sea, fresh water, and sky) are considered in 8:7–12.</p></div>"

The early association of the tribe of Dan with idolatry (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Judg 18\">Judg. 18</a>) may explain its omission from this list (21:8; 22:15). Some think that the 144,000 here includes only Jewish believers. But the “servants of our God” in v. 3 must include Gentile saints as well. The equal status of Gentiles and Jews in the seven churches (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Eph 2:11-Eph 2:22\">Eph. 2:11–22</a>) and the promises associated only with the 144,000 (9:4; 14:1–5) confirm this. According to vv. 1–8, the saints are known by God individually, and none slips by His care (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 10:30\">Matt. 10:30</a>); according to vv. 9–17, no human can count their number.</p></div>"
