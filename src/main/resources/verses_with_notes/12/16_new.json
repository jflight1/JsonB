The early association of the tribe of Dan with idolatry (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Judg 18\">Judg. 18</a>) may explain its omission from this list (21:8; 22:15). Some think that the 144,000 here includes only Jewish believers. But the “servants of our God” in v. 3 must include Gentile saints as well. The equal status of Gentiles and Jews in the seven churches (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Eph 2:11-Eph 2:22\">Eph. 2:11–22</a>) and the promises associated only with the 144,000 (9:4; 14:1–5) confirm this.
