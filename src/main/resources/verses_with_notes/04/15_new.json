Jesus often presented the kingdom as a hidden and growing reality (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 13:31-Matt 13:33\">Matt. 13:31–33</a>), which is both present and future. In the earthly ministry of Jesus, the kingdom is already present (11:20), but the full reality of the kingdom is yet to be manifested (cf. 19:11). Christians are to pray for the full realization of God’s kingdom (11:2). See theological note “The Kingdom of God.”</p></div>"
