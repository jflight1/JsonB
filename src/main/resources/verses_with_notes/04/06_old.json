He anticipates, however, that those with uncircumcised hearts and ears will raise questions denying these truths, and will seek to establish a righteousness of their own (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Deut 6:12\">vv. 12</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Deut 6:13\">13</a>). Moses rebukes such stubbornness, insisting that the word of righteousness is found “in your mouth and in your heart” (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Deut 6:14\">v. 14</a>)—in the mouth and heart that speak not in the unbelief and rebellion of their own righteousness, but in the faith and humility of the Lord’s righteousness. This righteousness the Lord demonstrated in the works of salvation and judgment, by which He confirmed His oath to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (cf. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Deut 8:17\">8:17</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Deut 8:18\">18</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Deut 9:4-Deut 9:6\">9:4–6</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Deut 30:1-Deut 30:7\">30:1–7</a>; especially <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Deut 1:29-Deut 1:33\">1:29–33</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Deut 9:23\">9:23</a>). The commandment that Moses proclaimed here was a word calling for faith, and the righteousness it reveals is a righteousness attained by faith (cf. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Deut 9:10\">v. 10</a> note). Paul alludes to these verses in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 10:6-Rom 10:8\">Rom. 10:6–8</a>, updating Moses’ admonition in view of the revelation of God’s righteousness in the Person and work of Christ. Paul preaches the word that calls for faith where Moses had to leave off, insisting that Israel (and the Gentiles, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 10:12\">Rom. 10:12</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 10:13\">13</a>) must now confess with their mouths that Jesus is Lord (cf. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Deut 6:4\">Deut. 6:4</a>), and believe with their hearts that God raised Him from the dead (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 10:9\">Rom. 10:9</a>). God’s work in Jesus Christ yet again reveals His righteousness (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 3:21-Rom 3:26\">Rom. 3:21–26</a>), and confirms His oath to the fathers (cf. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 4:18-Rom 4:25\">Rom. 4:18–25</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gal 3\">Gal. 3</a>).
