Abimelech was an anti-deliverer, an oppressor of the people, and a breaker of the covenant. His story raises the question of who should be king (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Judg 9:2\">9:2</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Judg 9:8-Judg 9:20\">8–20</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Judg 9:28\">28</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Judg 9:29\">29</a>). In light of this question, it is significant that Abimelech and Saul resemble each other in important ways (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Judg 9:23\">9:23</a> note; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Judg 9:54\">9:54</a> note). This would imply that Saul was the same sort of king that Abimelech was. The message to the readers of Judges was that they should no more want Ish-bosheth the son of Saul to be their king, than Israel had wanted Abimelech, the son of Gideon.</p></div>"
