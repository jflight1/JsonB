First, concern for worldly goods is foolish because life itself is more important (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Luke 12:23\">v. 23</a>). Second, God will take care of His own, just as He cares for the birds of the air (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Luke 12:24\">v. 24</a>). Third, anxiety accomplishes nothing (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Luke 12:25\">vv. 25</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Luke 12:26\">26</a>). Finally, as heirs of the inexhaustible riches of the kingdom of God, believers should not worry about earthly details (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Luke 12:32\">vv. 32</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Luke 12:33\">33</a>).
