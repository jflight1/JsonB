The man might have borrowed four hundred gallons of oil and had the bill made out for eight hundred, the extra being the equivalent of a high rate of interest. By significantly reducing the amount of interest the debtor owed, the manager would have obliged the debtor to assist him personally (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Luke 16:4\">v. 4</a>), at least for a time, without diminishing the principal owed to his own master.</p></div>"
