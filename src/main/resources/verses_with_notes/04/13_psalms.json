Chief among them is the “gods” mentioned in vv. 1 and <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ps 82:6\">6</a>. A number of scholars take this as a reference to angelic powers, lesser spiritual beings who make up God’s heavenly council. A second interpretation understands “gods” literally, as deities made subordinate to Yahweh. The most probable interpretation is that the “gods” are human judges. The Hebrew word <i>’elohim</i> (“gods”) is used of human judges in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 21:6\">Ex. 21:6</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 22:8\">22:8</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 22:9\">9</a>. Within <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ps 82\">Ps. 82</a>, the human nature of these “gods” is indicated by vv. 6, 7. A rough paraphrase would be, “As judges, people may call you ‘lord,’ but you are as mortal as anyone else.”</p></div>"
