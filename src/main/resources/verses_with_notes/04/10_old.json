Ch. 1 introduces the answer to this question, namely, that even “after the death of Moses” the Lord was faithful to His promises. See Introduction: Characteristics and Themes. This reality and its consequences are spelled out by God to Joshua (vv. 1–9), and then by Joshua to the people in general (vv. 10, 11) and the two-and-a-half tribes in particular (vv. 12–15).

It was also given to Abraham (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 26:24\">Gen. 26:24</a>) and will be applied to Joshua on his death (24:29).</p><p><b>Joshua.</b> Joshua’s name was changed from “Hoshea” (“salvation”) to “Joshua” (“the Lord is salvation”) by Moses (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Num 13:16\">Num. 13:16</a>). Joshua appears as Moses’ assistant as early as <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 17\">Ex. 17</a>. He was one of the men sent from Kadesh-barnea to explore the land (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Num 13:8\">Num. 13:8</a>), and he joined Caleb in calling on the Israelites to trust the Lord and not to rebel against Him (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Num 14:6-Num 14:9\">Num. 14:6–9</a>). Like Caleb (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Deut 1:36\">Deut. 1:36</a>), he escaped the judgment that fell on that generation because of its refusal to obey God at Kadesh-barnea. Joshua is presented as the successor to Moses, as was anticipated before Moses’ death (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Num 27:12-Num 27:23\">Num. 27:12–23</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Deut 3:28\">Deut. 3:28</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Deut 31:1-Deut 31:8\">31:1–8</a>). Joshua’s role, however, continues to be subordinate to that of Moses. This is expressed in his submission to the “Book of the Law” (1:8 note) and his obedience to the commands of Moses, something repeatedly emphasized throughout the book (e.g., 1:7; 8:31; 11:12, 15; 14:2, 5; 20:2). In the transition from Moses to Joshua there is continuity because the purpose of God for Israel persists, but there is discontinuity too, because the era of Moses was unique and is the standard of comparison for future generations. There is a similar continuity and discontinuity in the New Testament transition from the Gospels to the Book of Acts.</p></div>"
