There is no parallel to this unit as a whole in the other Gospels, though there are parallels to some of the individual sections. Luke presents the solemn progress to the capital city where Jesus would die for sinners in accordance with the will of God. On the way He gives the disciples teaching that would be important for them when they were left to carry on as Christian leaders without His physical presence.</p></div>"

If the father was dead, Jesus’ words are all the more shocking, since filial piety demanded that a son should look after the burial arrangements for his father.
