    "text" : "<div class=\"article\"><p><b><a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=John 1:1\">1:1</a></b> <b>the Word.</b> The term “Word” (Greek <i>logos</i>) designates God the Son with respect to His deity; “Jesus” and “Christ” refer to His incarnation and saving work. During the first three centuries, doctrines of the Person of Christ focused intensely on His position as the Logos. In Greek philosophy, the Logos was “reason” or “logic” as an abstract force that brought order and harmony to the universe. But in John’s writings such qualities of the Logos are gathered in the Person of Christ. In Neo-Platonic philosophy and the Gnostic heresy (second and third centuries <span class=\"small-caps\">a.d.</span>), the Logos was seen as one of many intermediate powers between God and the world. Such notions are far removed from the simplicity of John’s Gospel.</p><p>In this verse the Word is expressly affirmed to be God. The Word existed already “in the beginning” (a clear reference to the opening words of the Bible), which is a way of denoting the eternity that is unique to God. John states clearly, “the Word was God.” Some have observed that the word translated “God” here has no definite article, and argued on this basis that it means “a god” rather than “God.” This is a misunderstanding; the article is omitted because of the word order in the Greek sentence (the predicate “God” has been placed first for emphasis). The New Testament never endorses the idea of “a god,” an expression that implies polytheism and is in sharp conflict with the consistent monotheism of the Bible. In the New Testament, the Greek word for “God” occurs often without the definite article, depending on the requirements of Greek grammar.</p><p>That “the Word was with God,” indicates a distinction of Persons within the unity of the Godhead. Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are not successive forms of appearance of one Person, but are eternal Persons present from “the beginning” (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=John 1:2\">v. 2</a>). “With” suggests a relationship of close personal intimacy. See “One and Three: The Trinity” at <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 44:6\">Is. 44:6</a>.</p></div>"

However, the plural verb “were born” shows that this verse is about the new birth of Christian believers (cf. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=John 3:3\">3:3</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=John 3:5\">5</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=John 3:7\">7</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=John 3:8\">8</a>). This new birth takes place by the action of the Spirit giving life to those who were “dead in . . . trespasses and sins” (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Eph 2:1\">Eph. 2:1</a>). The new birth, often called “regeneration,” is explained more fully in 3:1–21. Paul uses the metaphor of a resurrection from death in sin rather than the image of rebirth (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 6:4-Rom 6:6\">Rom. 6:4–6</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Eph 2:5\">Eph. 2:5</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Eph 2:6\">6</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Col 2:13\">Col. 2:13</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Col 3:1\">3:1</a>; cf. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=John 5:24\">John 5:24</a>).

To some of John’s contemporaries, spirit and the divine were utterly opposed to matter and flesh. To others, the gods were thought to visit the earth disguised as human beings (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Acts 14:11\">Acts 14:11</a>). But here a chasm is bridged: the eternal Word of God did not merely appear to be a human being, but actually became flesh. He took to Himself a full and genuine human nature. See theological note “Jesus Christ, God and Man” on next page.</p><p><b>dwelt among us.</b> “Dwelt” means “pitched His tent.” This not only indicates the temporary nature of Jesus’ earthly existence, but does so in a way that recalls ancient Israel’s tabernacle, where God could be found (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 40:34\">Ex. 40:34</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 40:35\">35</a>).</p><p><b>we have seen his glory.</b> His “glory” is beheld, even as God’s was in the wilderness (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 16:1-Exod 16:10\">Ex. 16:1–10</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 33:18-Exod 33:23\">33:18–23</a>), in the tabernacle (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 40:34-Exod 40:35\">Ex. 40:34–35</a>), and later in the temple (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Kgs 8:1-1Kgs 8:11\">1 Kin. 8:1–11</a>). There may also be a reference to the Transfiguration, since John witnessed it (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 17:1-Matt 17:5\">Matt. 17:1–5</a>). “Glory” applies supremely to God, who is the Creator and Ruler of the universe, and before whom all knees must bow. The Son has the divine glory by right (17:5). The Reformers declared their faith with the motto, <i>Soli Deo Gloria</i> (“To God alone the glory”).</p><p><b>the only Son.</b> This phrase translates a single Greek word and explicitly points to the eternal generation of the Son in the Trinity.</p><p><b>full of grace and truth.</b> These words correspond to Old Testament terms describing God’s covenant mercy that are often translated “steadfast love and faithfulness” (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 24:27\">Gen. 24:27</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ps 25:10\">Ps. 25:10</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Prov 16:6\">Prov. 16:6</a>; cf. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 34:6\">Ex. 34:6</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ps 26:3\">Ps. 26:3</a>).
