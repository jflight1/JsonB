Or it may refer to the punitive hardening of a large segment of Israel in their culpable rejection of Christ, a hardening that Jesus saw as the fulfillment of Isaiah’s dire prophecy (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 6:9\">Is. 6:9</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 6:10\">10</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 13:14\">Matt. 13:14</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 13:15\">15</a>).
