This may be a prophecy of the catastrophe which overtook Jerusalem in <span class=\"small-caps\">a.d.</span> 70, within twenty years of Paul’s writing, or it may refer to the sequence of calamities that had already begun and were to reach their culmination in that momentous disaster. Or it may refer to the punitive hardening of a large segment of Israel in their culpable rejection of Christ, a hardening that Jesus saw as the fulfillment of Isaiah’s dire prophecy (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 6:9\">Is. 6:9</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 6:10\">10</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 13:14\">Matt. 13:14</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 13:15\">15</a>).

As Paul would later write (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 11:25\">Rom. 11:25</a>), a “partial hardening” has befallen Israel and will remain until the full number of Gentiles are brought in (i.e., until the end). The part of Israel not subject to hardening is the remnant (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 6:13\">Is. 6:13</a>) that in the gospel era continues as the object of God’s mercy, finding salvation in Jesus the Messiah.</p></div>"
