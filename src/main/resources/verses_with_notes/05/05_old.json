Civil war between the tribes was the result. This final story in the conclusion of Judges blames the misery of Israel on the lack of a king (19:1; 21:25; cf. 17:6; 18:1). Benjamin was the tribe that sinned. Even more, it was the men of Gibeah, Saul’s hometown, that behaved like the people of Sodom. Saul’s action in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Sam 11:6-1Sam 11:8\">1 Sam. 11:6–8</a> is clearly parallel to the Levite’s desecration of his concubine (19:29 note). Finally, Judah, the tribe of David, was the Lord’s choice to be the leader against Benjamin (note the similarity of wording between 1:1–2 and 20:18). The Benjaminites had practically become Canaanites. No one was without fault, however. Each tribe was doing as it saw fit (21:25). The conclusion to be drawn is that a king was needed, a king from Judah and not Benjamin. David and not Saul would initially qualify. Yet, being a man, even David would prove unequal to the task, as later developments would show (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Sam 12:10\">2 Sam. 12:10</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Sam 12:11\">11</a>).
