With a congenital affliction the explanation could be that the sin had been committed in the womb, or by the parents whose sinful act victimized their child. Jesus dismisses these as improper explanations (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=John 9:3\">v. 3</a>), but this is not to say that certain trials are not the God-ordained punishment for certain sins (e.g., the life of David after His adultery and murder, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Sam 12-2Sam 21\">2 Sam. 12–21</a>). Neither does Jesus here dismiss the biblical doctrine of original sin (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 5:12-Rom 5:21\">Rom. 5:12–21</a>), which teaches that all suffering is the consequence of our corporate sin and rebellion in Adam. But it is unwise and uncharitable to judge that the sufferings of others are specifically punitive (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 7:1\">Matt. 7:1</a>). The question put to Jesus presents a false dilemma. Only two possibilities were given as reasons for the man’s affliction, his own sin or the sin of his parents. Jesus offers a third option (v. 3).</p></div>"
