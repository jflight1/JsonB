References to the king as the Lord’s anointed are prevalent in the books of Samuel (v. 35; 12:3, 5; 16:6; 24:6) and Psalms (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ps 2:2\">Ps. 2:2</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ps 18:50\">18:50</a>). The present passage is the first reference to a king of Israel as God’s “anointed,” though the idea of anointing a king is found already in Jotham’s fable (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Judg 9:8\">Judg. 9:8</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Judg 9:15\">15</a>). The English word “messiah” represents the Hebrew word meaning “anointed.” In the New Testament, “Christ” represents the Greek word <i>Christos,</i> also meaning “anointed.”</p></div>"
