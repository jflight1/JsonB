The arrest of Jesus is recorded in vv. 1–18, the trial before Annas in vv. 19–27, and the trial before Pilate in vv. 28–40.</p><p>The accounts of the four Gospels cover the major events of the arrest, trial, execution, and resurrection of Jesus. While some difficulties arise in the correlation of details, the main elements are in complete harmony. Jesus was arrested at night. His trial before the Jewish authorities had at least two phases, and during this part of the trial Peter denied Jesus three times. The trial before secular powers had three phases, and Jesus was executed by Pilate’s soldiers. He was buried in Joseph of Arimathea’s tomb, and on the first day of the week He arose from the dead and was seen alive in a variety of appearances to His disciples. None of the difficulties in the correlation of details is insuperable, but in a number of cases more than one explanation is possible, and in the absence of fuller data, it is difficult to choose among them.</p></div>"

It is difficult to determine whether this verse and vv. 19–24 represent one or two phases of a trial before the Jewish authorities. Matthew, Mark, and Luke refer to an additional phase before the Sanhedrin. Judging from the description of rules for trials found in the <i>Mishnah</i> of some two hundred years later, the proceedings here were marked by serious irregularities and violations of Jewish law. The Sanhedrin was not supposed to meet at night; the death penalty could not be declared on the day of the trial; there was false evidence, and false witnesses were used (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 26:59\">Matt. 26:59</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 26:60\">60</a>); Jesus was exposed to blows from attendants during the trial (v. 22; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Mark 14:65\">Mark 14:65</a>). In addition to all this, it was illegal for the Sanhedrin to meet for a capital case on the eve of a Sabbath or a feast day. These violations show that Jesus’ condemnation by the Jewish authorities was a travesty of justice.</p></div>"
