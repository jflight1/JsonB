Here He indicates that God is present in Him. The temple in Jerusalem could be destroyed, but not the temple that Jesus would rebuild in three days, His own body that was to be raised from the dead. John’s record of the temple cleansing immediately after the miracle at Cana (vv. 1–11 note) offers an important key to the whole of Jesus’ ministry. In these events are signaled replacement of the old order (water of ceremonial cleansing, Herod’s temple) with the new (the wine of salvation, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 25:6-Isa 25:9\">Is. 25:6–9</a>; the risen Lamb as the new temple, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 21:22\">Rev. 21:22</a>).</p><p>Matthew, Mark, and Luke report a cleansing of the temple in the week of Jesus’ crucifixion.
