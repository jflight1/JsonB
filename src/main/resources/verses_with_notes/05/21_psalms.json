As the last song of the group, it may have been the final psalm in the mind of Jesus as He celebrated Passover with His disciples (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Mark 14:26\">Mark 14:26</a>). Jesus quoted vv. 22, 23 about Himself (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Mark 12:10\">Mark 12:10</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Mark 12:11\">11</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 23:29\">Matt. 23:29</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Luke 13:35\">Luke 13:35</a>; cf. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Acts 4:11\">Acts 4:11</a>). The people greeted Jesus’ triumphal entry with shouts of joy taken from this psalm (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Mark 11:9\">Mark 11:9</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Mark 11:10\">10</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Luke 19:38\">Luke 19:38</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=John 12:13\">John 12:13</a>). The main speaker is likely the king (vv. 5–21), but the psalm as a whole is a liturgy with other speakers as well (vv. 21–27). The references to altar, temple, and procession (vv. 19, 20, 27) show that it was used in corporate worship.</p></div>"
