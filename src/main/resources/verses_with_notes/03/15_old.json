In the vivid portrayal of divine opposition to those who curse His people, God’s faithfulness to the covenant promises made to Abraham is demonstrated (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 12:3\">Gen. 12:3</a> and note). Ironically, the Lord also used the pagan prophet Balaam, who had been hired by the Moabite king to curse God’s people, to bless them instead, and to prophesy the coming of a royal Star out of Jacob—the Messiah Himself—who would triumph over Israel’s enemies (24:17–19).</p></div>"
