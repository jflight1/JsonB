Finally, provisions are made for direction and guidance of the community (9:15–10:10).</p></div>"

A person could take a special vow of separation for a limited period of time, during which they were not to eat or drink anything that came from the grapevine, and were not to cut their hair or beard. The grapevine was a source of physical pleasure, and abstention from it represented a life given over to God. Allowing the hair to grow signified abstention from human adornment.</p><p>During the period for which the vow was taken, the Nazirite was to be careful to avoid becoming ceremonially unclean for any reason (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Num 6:7\">v. 7</a>).
