If the first coming of the Son of Man is characterized by suffering and humiliation (8:31 note), His future coming at the end will be an open declaration of His divine glory. Such a coming recalls the visible manifestations of God (theophanies) in the Old Testament (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 19:16\">Ex. 19:16</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 34:5\">34:5</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ezek 1:4\">Ezek. 1:4</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ezek 10:3\">10:3</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ezek 10:4\">4</a>), with the difference that this one will be universal.

Then v. 27 would refer to the worldwide spread of the gospel that followed that event. The “angels” there would be the messengers of the gospel (<i>angelos</i> is the Greek word for “messenger,” either human or angelic). On this view, Jesus’ first reference to the end (His Second Coming) is not until v. 32 (“that day”).</p></div>"
