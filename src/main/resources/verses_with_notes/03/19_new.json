Some of the names differ and the order is different. Some suggest that Matthew has Joseph’s line and Luke Mary’s, but Luke specifically starts with “Joseph.” It may be that Matthew is giving not direct ancestors but those who would have been legally in line for the throne of David. Both evangelists emphasize that Jesus was of Davidic descent.</p></div>"
