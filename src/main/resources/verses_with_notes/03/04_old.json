A census of fighting men is taken (ch. 1). Then measures to ensure the order and purity of the camp are related—the organization of the camp, the commissioning of the Levites and their ministry, and various provisions for ceremonial purity and religious observance. Finally, provisions are made for direction and guidance of the community (9:15–10:10).</p></div>"
