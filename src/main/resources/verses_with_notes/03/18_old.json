Zelophehad had died without leaving a male heir, and his daughters petitioned Moses and the leaders to allow the daughters to inherit their father’s portion in the land, and not to let his name be cut off. The names of all five daughters are recorded in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Num 27:1\">v. 1</a>.</p><p>In <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Num 36\">ch. 36</a> a related question was raised by the tribal leaders: if the daughters of Zelophehad married men of a different tribe, would their father’s inheritance be transferred to that tribe? In response to both questions, the Lord answered that the family and tribal legacies should be protected (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Num 27:7\">27:7</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Num 36:6\">36:6</a>). These protections, as well as the prohibition against permanent transfer of land from one family to another, were rooted in God’s ultimate ownership of the Promised Land (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 25:23\">Lev. 25:23</a>), and that He had entrusted it to all His people as a good gift and permanent possession to be enjoyed (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 25:34\">Lev. 25:34</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Deut 6:10-Deut 6:12\">Deut. 6:10–12</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Deut 8:10-Deut 8:13\">8:10–13</a>). The land was not simply private property to be transferred on the basis of human convention and agreement. Rather, it symbolized life with God.</p></div>"
