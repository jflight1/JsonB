Such miracles were powerful messianic signs (v. 22). These “resurrections” differ from the resurrection of Christ, however, for these three were reunited with their mortal bodies only to die once more. As the first to be clothed with an imperishable, spiritual body (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 15:42-1Cor 15:44\">1 Cor. 15:42–44</a>), Jesus is indeed the “firstborn from the dead” (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Col 1:18\">Col. 1:18</a>; cf. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 15:20\">1 Cor. 15:20</a>).</p></div>"

Some think his faith had failed in the harsh conditions of Herod’s prison, others that his patience had given out and he was suggesting that Jesus should actively bring in the kingdom. More probably he looked for Jesus to bring judgment, a note that John had stressed in his own ministry. He could not understand why Jesus did not punish sinners, but constantly performed deeds of mercy. Would somebody else come to carry out the threats of judgment?</p></div>"
