It was observed the last day before the first full moon after the spring equinox. From that day when the paschal lambs were killed and eaten, all leaven (symbolizing sin) was to be removed from the house, and only unleavened bread was to be eaten for seven days. This observance was known as the “Feast of Unleavened Bread” (14:12; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 12:15-Exod 12:20\">Ex. 12:15–20</a>), and was closely associated with Passover.</p><p><b>chief priests.</b> See note 8:31.</p><p><b>scribes.</b> See note 7:1.</p></div>"
