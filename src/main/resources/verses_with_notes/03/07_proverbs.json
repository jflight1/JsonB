There is no evidence that these are a form of wisdom writing from a different time than the longer instructions of <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Prov 1-Prov 9\">chs. 1–9</a>. They are simply different forms, and function in different ways. Aphorisms are often stated categorically, without the qualifications that might allow them to cover every conceivable situation.</p><p>The wisdom of Proverbs presupposes and builds upon the special revelation of God in the Law (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Prov 1:7\">1:7</a> and notes). The Hebrew sages assumed that, given human intelligence and the gift of God’s wisdom in His self-revelation, God’s people learn to discern the order and relationships that make for a meaningful and productive life. The wisdom of Proverbs gives the fruit of experience and reflection, stressing the need to think through and to apply human knowledge and the Word of God to all the affairs of life in a responsible way.</p></div>"

The individual sentences can be classified according to their literary structures and their themes. Chapters 10–15 consist mainly of contrasts between opposites, as indicated by the conjunction “but” introducing the second line of most of these proverbs. This common literary device uses contrasting pairs such as “righteous” versus “wicked” and “wise” versus “fool.” Occasional grouping of sentences according to theme and form is evident in the book, a method that aids memorization but does not assist the interpretation of the mostly independent sayings. Each sentence has its own social setting and special aim. Much like folk sayings in our Western societies, some of the sayings have been separated from their contexts in order to provide concise, practical guidelines for living.</p></div>"

The wisdom writers remind us that the source of all true knowledge and wisdom is the self-revelation of God in His creative, providential, and saving works, and especially in the Scriptures.</p></div>"

Here is another proverb grounded in God’s covenant with Israel. The “land” is that promised to Israel, and its possession is basic to life. Possession of the land was conditional upon the response of faith to the covenant promises.</p></div>"
