But that view, which presupposes an evolutionary theory of the development of Israelite religion, misreads this verse. The reference here to “the place” certainly need not imply that the location of the temple in Jerusalem was known when this text was written. In the course of Israel’s history, worship of the Lord was successively centered in several places: Shiloh (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Josh 18:1\">Josh. 18:1</a>) and Gibeon (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Chr 16:39\">1 Chr. 16:39</a>), as well as later in Jerusalem. The stress here is on the contrast between “the place . . . the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> your God will choose” and “the places where the nations . . . served their gods” (v. 2). Purity of worship in obedience to divine command, rather than centralization, is primarily in view.</p></div>"
