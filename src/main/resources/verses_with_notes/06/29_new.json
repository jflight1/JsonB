The pilgrims came to worship the goddess Diana (Artemis in Greek) who was portrayed by a famous statue at Ephesus as a fertility goddess with many breasts. Her “image” which had fallen “from the sky” (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Acts 19:35\">v. 35</a>) was probably a meteorite that the people had begun to worship. The temple of Artemis was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Not only was it the object of religious pilgrimage, but it was a banking depository as well.
