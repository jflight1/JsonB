This song focuses on the Lord’s deliverance of David. It may be outlined as follows: introductory praise of God as “savior” (vv. 2–4); the psalmist’s distress (vv. 5, 6); the psalmist’s petition (v. 7); the Lord’s response in cosmic demonstration (vv. 8–16) and personal rescue (vv. 17–20); the psalmist’s innocence (vv. 21–25) and the Lord’s faithfulness (vv. 26–30); the Lord’s deliverance (vv. 31–37) and the psalmist’s resultant victories (vv. 38–46); concluding praise of God as Savior (vv. 47–51). <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ps 144\">Ps. 144</a>, also ascribed to David, shows many similarities in theme and language.</p><p><b>all his enemies.</b> See 8:1–14; cf. 5:8; 7:1, 9, 11; 18:32.</p><p><b>from the hand of Saul.</b> See 12:7; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Sam 18-1Sam 31\">1 Sam. 18–31</a> (especially 18:9–11; 19:2, 10–11, 15–16).</p></div>"
