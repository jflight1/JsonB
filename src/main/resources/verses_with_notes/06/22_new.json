Only one couple welcomed them, and in return their cottage was changed into a temple with a golden roof and marble columns. The houses of those who had refused the gods were destroyed. The Lystrans may have been thinking of this legend when they welcomed Barnabas and Paul and prepared to sacrifice oxen.</p></div>"
