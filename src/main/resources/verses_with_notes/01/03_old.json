There are some similarities, as well as significant differences, between this material and the Sumerian King List (written c. 2000 <span class=\"small-caps\">b.c.</span> ), which mentions eight antediluvian (pre-Flood) kings who reigned for exceptionally long periods (up to 72,000 years). Following the Sumerian flood account (cf. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 6-Gen 9\">chs. 6–9</a>), there is another list of shorter-lived postdiluvians (cf. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 11\">ch. 11</a>).</p><p>More significant are the formal similarities and material differences between this Sethite genealogy and the Cainite genealogy in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 4\">ch. 4</a>. Both are initially linear, focusing on one individual in each generation, and both conclude by dividing the line among three sons (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 4:20-Gen 4:22\">4:20–22</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 5:32\">5:32</a>; the same is true in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 11:10-Gen 11:26\">11:10–26</a>). But the central themes of these genealogies contrast sharply. Cain’s line dies in the Flood; Seth’s lives through it. Whereas the former presents the curse-laden line of Cain that concludes with murderer begetting murderer (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 4:17-Gen 4:24\">4:17–24</a>), the latter links the founder of humanity, Adam, with its re-founder, Noah (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 4:25\">4:25</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 4:26\">26</a> note). The Enoch and Lamech in Seth’s line cannot be confused with the first and last descendants bearing these names in Cain’s line. Enoch, the seventh in the line of Seth, “walked with God” and “God took him” (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 4:24\">v. 24</a>); and the Sethite Lamech names his son Noah, hoping the Lord will “bring us relief” (cf. v. 29).</p><p>Because the Hebrew word translated “fathered” often means “became the ancestor of,” and because some of the numbers appear to be symbolic, many scholars argue that there are gaps in these genealogies, and that they therefore cannot be used to compute a precise chronology. The significant seventh generation of each genealogy marks a high point—the height of wickedness in the Cainite Lamech (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 4:18-Gen 4:24\">4:18–24</a>), and the height of godliness in the Sethite Enoch (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 4:18-Gen 4:24\">vv. 18–24</a>; cf. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 4:21-Gen 4:24\">vv. 21–24</a> note). The figure of ten generations from Seth to Noah (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 4:3-Gen 4:26\">vv. 3–32</a>) matches the ten generations from Shem to Abram in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 11:10-Gen 11:26\">11:10–26</a> (this latter genealogy appears to contain gaps, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 11:10-Gen 11:26\">11:10–26</a> note; cf. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 1:17\">Matt. 1:17</a> note). Also, the ages of some antediluvians may be symbolic, and are perhaps related to astronomical periods known to the ancient Near Eastern peoples (e.g., the three hundred sixty-five years of Enoch’s life, vv. 21–24 note).</p></div>"

In a Babylonian flood account the hero shuts the door; God is the chief actor throughout the biblical account. In shutting the door, God also distinguishes between the righteous and the wicked (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 6:18-Gen 6:20\">6:18–20</a> note). Elsewhere in Scripture doors provide safety for God’s people in times of judgment.

Jesus uses this symbol of separation in describing the safety of the righteous in the day of the Lord’s coming (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 25:10-Matt 25:13\">Matt. 25:10–13</a>).</p></div>"
