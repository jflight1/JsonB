It starts on a negative note with the shattering of the covenant family’s peace (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 37\">ch. 37</a>) and their intermarriage with the Canaanites (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 38\">ch. 38</a>), but concludes with the family’s reconciliation and preservation in Egypt.</p><p>Just as Jacob figured prominently in the “account of Isaac,” so also does Joseph in the “generations of Jacob.” God used Joseph, the rejected, godly brother, to save and reconcile the covenant family (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 45:5-Gen 45:8\">45:5–8</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 50:24\">50:24</a>).
