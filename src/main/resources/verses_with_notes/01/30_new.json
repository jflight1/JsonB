That the disciples would drink this cup means they would experience suffering, but note that Jesus calls it “my cup.” Because Jesus drank the cup of God’s wrath for His own, believers do not drink the wrath they deserve. In and through Christ’s suffering they have already undergone judgment. They are now justified in Christ and heirs of His glory (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 8:17\">Rom. 8:17</a>). Yet their privilege is to be identified with Christ in His sufferings (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Pet 2:21\">1 Pet. 2:21</a>).</p></div>"

Jesus drinks the cup of God’s wrath (v. 23), not for His own sins, but as the means of ransoming many.</p><p><b>for many.</b> The Greek preposition translated “for” can also be translated “in the place of.” It expresses the substitutionary nature of Jesus’ suffering.
