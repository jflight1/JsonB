Both the story of the ruler’s daughter and the story of the woman with a hemorrhage illustrate the relation between the work of Jesus and the role of faith in the kingdom. The same point appears in the following accounts of the blind man and the mute demoniac. These works (raising the dead, healing the sick, etc.) are in response to faith, not because faith causes them, but because without faith in the King Himself they are not signs of the kingdom but only unaccountable events with no special meaning.</p></div>"

The emphasis here is on the proclamation of the gospel, the eschatological announcement that precedes judgment and urges people to repent and have faith. The “laborers” are not the angels sent to gather for judgment (13:49) but disciples who imitate Jesus by proclaiming the coming of the kingdom (10:7). Jesus does not yet command His disciples to go into the harvest as laborers, but to pray to God to send workers. No one can do the work of harvest without being called to it and equipped for it by God.</p></div>"
