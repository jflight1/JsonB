They usually have one central point or idea. Most of Jesus’ parables are clear, but they also contain a depth of meaning that only one with a right relationship to Jesus can comprehend. It is only to the disciples that Jesus gives the interpretation of the parable of the sower (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 13:18-Matt 13:23\">vv. 18–23</a>) and the parable of the weeds (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 13:36-Matt 13:43\">vv. 36–43</a>).

Though some argue that Matthew softens the note of divine sovereignty seen in Mark, the word “lest” in v. 15 indicates that God’s sovereign choice lies behind the hardening of their hearts whether it precedes (Matthew) or follows (Mark) an encounter with Jesus’ teaching. While in this passage Matthew highlights the moral responsibility of those who reject Christ, his inclusion of the reference to <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 6:9\">Is. 6:9</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 6:10\">10</a> illustrates the compatibility of God’s sovereignty and human responsibility.
