Jesus will undertake the suffering He describes as the Servant of the Lord (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 53\">Is. 53</a>). It appears that no one before Jesus had ever identified the Messiah, the Son of Man, and the Suffering Servant of the Old Testament as three aspects of the one Redeemer and King. The disciples are so overwhelmed by their difficulty in accepting the suffering of the Messiah that they apparently do not even hear the promise of the Resurrection. At least they did not initially believe it (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Luke 24:25\">Luke 24:25</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Luke 24:37\">37</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Luke 24:38\">38</a>).</p></div>"

The passage is not about paying taxes to the civil authority (22:21). Jesus’ point is that the Christ and His disciples enjoy a relationship with God that frees them from the obligations imposed upon “others.” Yet Jesus is willing to conform to previous requirements in order to avoid giving offense. Paul advised (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 14:13-Rom 14:21\">Rom. 14:13–21</a>) and practiced (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Acts 16:3\">Acts 16:3</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Acts 21:26\">21:26</a>) similar continued observance of some ritual requirements of the Old Testament law.</p></div>"
