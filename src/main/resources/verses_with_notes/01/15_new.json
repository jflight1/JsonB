This does not mean Matthew invented the occasion. Matthew presents the teaching of Jesus in five major discourses, and he may have brought in relevant material delivered on other occasions. Particularly <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 10:17-Matt 10:22\">10:17–22</a>, which envisions a world mission and being “dragged before governors and kings” (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 10:18\">v. 18</a>), seems to go beyond <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 10:5\">v. 5</a>, that restricts the mission to Israel. Nevertheless, the future mission of the disciples to the whole world (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 28:18-Matt 28:20\">28:18–20</a>) is linked to this early experience of preaching to Israel, and Matthew’s grouping of the material is appropriate.</p></div>"

Just as Israel’s history foreshadows Jesus’ history (2:15 note), its turmoil and strife foreshadow the strife that results from the coming of the Messiah, even to the division of families. Although coming to Christ brings peace to the heart (11:29), embracing the gospel also makes life more difficult in some respects, because Jesus demands allegiance that takes priority over the natural ties of life (vv. 37–39).</p></div>"
