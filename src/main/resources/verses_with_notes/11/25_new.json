(b) Christ’s preaching in the short interval between His death and Resurrection, during a “descent into hell.” It is said that Christ announced His victory to the spirits of Noah’s wicked contemporaries confined in the realm of the dead. (c) A similar idea is that Christ proclaimed His victory to fallen angels, often identified with the “sons of God” of <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 6:2\">Gen. 6:2</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 6:4\">4</a> (cf. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Job 1:6\">Job 1:6</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Job 2:1\">2:1</a>), in their place of confinement.

The startling statement that baptism “saves you” shows how close is the relationship between the sign and the reality it signifies.

Baptism symbolizes judgment on sin in the death of Christ and then also renewal of life (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 6:4\">Rom. 6:4</a>).
