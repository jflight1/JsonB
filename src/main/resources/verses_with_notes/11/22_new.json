As exiles, Christians live in the world, but their real homeland is in heaven (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Phil 3:20\">Phil. 3:20</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Heb 11:13-Heb 11:16\">Heb. 11:13–16</a>) and their hope is anchored there.</p><p><b>the dispersion.</b> This word (Greek <i>diaspora</i>) was a technical term among Greek-speaking Jews for the Jews living outside Palestine (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=John 7:35\">John 7:35</a>). Here it is probably used figuratively to describe Christians as people who are away from their true homeland.</p><p><b>Pontus.</b> Although 1 Peter has the character of a general letter (like James, 2 Peter, 1 John, Jude), it differs from the other General Epistles in that it specifies the areas in which the readers lived.</p></div>"

The corresponding verb (“foreknown”) is used of Christ in v. 20.</p><p><b>in the sanctification of the Spirit.</b> Note the close connection of the Father’s electing love with the Spirit’s work of applying redemption to the elect (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Thess 2:13\">2 Thess. 2:13</a>). This “sanctification” includes all the Spirit’s operations in setting sinners apart from sin (including regeneration and faith) and purifying them for God’s service (sanctification in the progressive sense).</p><p><b>obedience.</b> The initial act of obedience is faith in Christ (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=John 6:28\">John 6:28</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=John 6:29\">29</a>) and the fundamental element of all obedience is continued faith. To suggest that election is on the basis of God’s foreknowledge (that is, mere foresight) of faith would introduce a contradiction into this verse, since election is “for” or with the goal of faith (obedience), and not because of it (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Eph 1:3\">Eph. 1:3</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Eph 1:4\">4</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Tim 1:9\">2 Tim. 1:9</a>).</p><p><b>his blood.</b> Sprinkling of blood was part of the Old Testament ritual service. In general, the appearance of blood advertises the death of a victim. Abel’s blood cried for vengeance (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 4:10\">Gen. 4:10</a>), and Jesus’ blood cries for forgiveness (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Luke 23:34\">Luke 23:34</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Heb 12:24\">Heb. 12:24</a>). In the worship of the Old Testament, the death of the victim establishes a covenant, and the sprinkling incorporates the worshipers as participants, making them publicly liable for the covenant’s benefits and responsibilities (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 24:8\">Ex. 24:8</a>).</p><p><b>grace and peace.</b> This greeting is also a blessing, and would have special relevance for suffering Christians. Grace is God’s loving favor to sinners in Christ, while peace is the objective condition of being right with God through Christ (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 5:1\">Rom. 5:1</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 5:2\">2</a>), together with all that flows from that relationship. This verse proclaims all three persons of the one God who blesses. See “One and Three: The Trinity” at <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 44:6\">Is. 44:6</a>.</p></div>"
