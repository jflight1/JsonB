This involves no conflict with Paul who also appeals to Abraham as the chief exhibit of one justified by faith. Note that James appeals to <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 22\">Gen. 22</a>, while Paul appeals to <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 15\">Gen. 15</a>. In the sight of God Abraham is justified in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 15\">Gen. 15</a>, long before he offers Isaac on the altar. God knew Abraham’s faith to be genuine. Abraham is justified to us, to human eyes, in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 22\">Gen. 22</a> when he shows his faith through his obedience. Jesus used the same verb in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Luke 7:35\">Luke 7:35</a> when he declared “wisdom is justified by all her children” (i.e., shown to be genuine wisdom by its results). Here, to “justify” does not mean to be reconciled to God but to demonstrate the truth of a prior claim. Just as true wisdom is demonstrated by its fruit, Abraham’s claim to faith is justified by his outward obedience. Yet his works were not the meritorious cause of his salvation; they added no merit to the perfect and sufficient merit of Christ.</p></div>"

A person is only shown to be just by what he or she does. None of our deeds are worthy of ultimate justification in the sight of God. Only the merit of Christ avails for that kind of justification. Only by trusting in Christ alone can we be made righteous in the sight of God. Here James attacks all forms of antinomianism that seek to have Jesus as Savior without embracing Him as Lord. Just as Paul demonstrated that trusting in one’s own works is deadly, so James teaches that resting on empty or dead faith is deadly. See theological note “Faith and Works” on next page.</p></div>"
