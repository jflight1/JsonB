He represents the most powerful kingdom on earth (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Dan 4:10-Dan 4:12\">vv. 10–12</a> note) as opposed to the rule of the Most High God. Babylonian records of long periods of absence and blasphemous acts by King Nabonidus (ruled 556 to 539 <span class=\"small-caps\">b.c.</span>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Dan 5:1\">5:1</a> note) resemble in some ways Daniel’s account of Nebuchadnezzar. Another composition called the “Prayer of Nabonidus” was discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls, documents hidden before <span class=\"small-caps\">a.d.</span> 70 by a Jewish community at Qumran and found in 1947. This “Prayer” is also similar to what Daniel says about Nebuchadnezzar. Nabonidus is separated from society for seven years and restored with the help of a Jewish exile following confession of his sins. However, his affliction is described as a form of skin disease rather than mental illness.</p></div>"
