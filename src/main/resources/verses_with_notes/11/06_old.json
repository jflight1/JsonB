This story concerns a king named Dan’el known to some extent for his righteousness, wisdom (cf. 28:3), and pity. “Noah, Daniel, and Job” would then designate non-Israelite figures from remote times known for their uprightness.

Foreign alliances were also regarded as evidence of a failure to trust God in the face of political difficulty. Such alliances were a breach of Israel’s exclusive allegiance to the Lord (cf. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ezek 23:7\">23:7</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ezek 29:16\">29:16</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 7\">Is. 7</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 8\">8</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 30\">30</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 31\">31</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Jer 2:36\">Jer. 2:36</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Jer 2:37\">37</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Jer 22:20-Jer 22:22\">22:20–22</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Hos 7:11-Hos 7:13\">Hos. 7:11–13</a>). The writer of Chronicles emphasizes this point particularly (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Chr 14:9-2Chr 14:15\">2 Chr. 14:9–15</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Chr 16:1-2Chr 16:9\">16:1–9</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Chr 19:1\">19:1</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Chr 19:2\">2</a>; 20; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Chr 25:6-2Chr 25:8\">25:6–8</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Chr 25:28\">28</a>).</p></div>"
