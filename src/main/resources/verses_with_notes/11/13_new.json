Isaac’s “resurrection” was only figurative, but believers who have died for their faith look forward to a literal resurrection (cf. v. 35), in which Jesus has led the way (13:20).</p></div>"

Although Moses experienced the quite natural apprehension that Pharaoh would do him personal harm if he stayed in Egypt, he did not fear that his divine commission to rescue God’s people was in jeopardy. With this hope in God’s purposes he left and “endured” in Midian.</p><p>It is possible, however, that this verse refers to the Exodus; here Moses clearly was without fear.
