In the Gospel, the incarnate Christ is the light that continues to shine in the darkness of a world that tries to exclude Him. Believers are faced with a choice: either to “walk in the light,” coming to Him and opening their hearts to Him in confession of sin, or to “walk in darkness,” denying that they are sinners. The contrast between light and darkness is inseparably linked to a contrast between those who “practice the truth” and agree with God, and those who make God “a liar.” It is an inescapable reality that believers sin; the remedy for sin—confession, and cleansing by the blood of Jesus—is God’s continuing irrevocable gift to believers. Because Jesus’ death has paid in full the penalty for sin, and because God has recognized Jesus as His true Son by raising Him from the dead, God grants forgiveness and cleansing as a matter of faithfulness and justice. He will not and cannot refuse.</p></div>"
