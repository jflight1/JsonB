The revelation at Sinai manifested the holy character of the covenant God and defined the character and behavior appropriate for God’s covenant people.</p><p>The Sinai covenant also underscores the special role of the mediator.

However, the face-to-face revelation so terrified the people that they pleaded with Moses to go up to God and receive the commands, then return and report to them (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 20:18-Exod 20:21\">20:18–21</a>).

Even Moses objected to the stringent preparations (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 19:23\">19:23</a>).
