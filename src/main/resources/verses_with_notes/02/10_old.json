The tabernacle and its ministry are the two central features—details of the tabernacle construction, and the precise elements, manner, and persons to be employed in God’s service are carefully specified. The inauguration of the covenant had established God’s kingship over Israel. That kingship was now to be appropriately recognized by the building of a residence for God as a symbol of His royal authority over Israel.</p></div>"
