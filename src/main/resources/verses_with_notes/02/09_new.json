Jesus celebrated Passover that evening, 15 Nisan, and was crucified the next afternoon. The Gospel of John seems to present Jesus as crucified on the day before Passover (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=John 18:28\">John 18:28</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=John 19:14\">19:14</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=John 19:31\">31</a>), making the Lord’s Supper not a Passover meal.</p><p>Calvin understood Preparation Day to be the day before Passover, and argued that the Jews according to some traditions combined the Passover with the weekly Sabbath (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=John 19:14\">John 19:14</a> note). Then <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 27:62\">Matt. 27:62</a> would refer to the Preparation Day observed by the Jewish leadership. There is some difficulty, however, in seeing how Jesus’ disciples could have had their lamb slaughtered in advance of the official schedule, and <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Mark 14:12\">Mark 14:12</a> clearly indicates that Jesus arranged for Passover on the day when the lambs were customarily slaughtered. Whatever the solution, Matthew clearly identifies the meal that Jesus ate with His disciples on the eve of His crucifixion as the Passover meal.</p></div>"

Jesus uttered these words while physically present with His disciples, so a literal identification of the elements with His physical substance would not have occurred to them.
