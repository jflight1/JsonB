The tabernacle and its ministry are the two central features—details of the tabernacle construction, and the precise elements, manner, and persons to be employed in God’s service are carefully specified. The inauguration of the covenant had established God’s kingship over Israel. That kingship was now to be appropriately recognized by the building of a residence for God as a symbol of His royal authority over Israel.</p></div>"

    "text" : "<div class=\"article\"><p><b><a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 26\">26:1–37</a></b> God reveals the pattern for the tabernacle proper. The tabernacle, God’s holy dwelling in the midst of His sinful people, served a double function. On the one hand, it protected the people from the dangers of unauthorized intrusion—the curtains of the Most Holy Place, of the Holy Place, and even of the courtyard stood between the people and the threat of God’s consuming holy presence. On the other hand, the tabernacle provided a way of approach to the Lord. Worshipers entered the outer court to pray and offer sacrifices; the priests carried the people’s petitions into the holy place; and once a year on the Day of Atonement the high priest entered the Most Holy Place, the very throne-room of the Almighty, with a blood atonement to meet the Lord at the mercy seat.</p><p>Nevertheless, the tabernacle was a provisional symbol, rather than the full reality, of God’s dwelling with man. It symbolized the heavenly temple of God (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Heb 8:1-Heb 8:6\">Heb. 8:1–6</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Heb 9:1-Heb 9:15\">9:1–15</a>), and pointed forward to the dwelling of God with man in Jesus Christ, God incarnate in human flesh (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=John 1:14\">John 1:14</a> note). As the author of Hebrews makes clear, the tabernacle and its ministry were insufficient in themselves (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Heb 10:1-Heb 10:4\">Heb. 10:1–4</a>). Rather, they foreshadowed the final and completely sufficient priestly work of Christ (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Heb 10:11-Heb 10:18\">Heb. 10:11–18</a>).</p></div>"
