Even after His mighty Exodus deliverance and miraculous provisions for them in the wilderness, they responded with complaints, recriminations, and the idolatrous worship of the golden calf (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 16:2\">16:2</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 16:3\">3</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 17:1-Exod 17:3\">17:1–3</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 32:1-Exod 32:6\">32:1–6</a>). We should note, however, that this section displays not only the treachery of Israel and the kindness of their God, but also the central role of Moses the mediator. Because the Lord was pleased with the mediator, He did not cast off the people and start anew to make a great nation out of Moses (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 32:10-Exod 32:14\">32:10–14</a>).</p><p>We should not conclude that Israel’s continuing in God’s favor was due solely to the merit of Moses as God’s mediator. Rather, the ground of Moses’ plea for mercy was his concern for God’s glory and his appeal to the gracious covenant promises God had made to the patriarchs (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 32:11-Exod 32:14\">32:11–14</a>). The crisis of Israel’s disloyalty, and the Lord’s threat to destroy them, is resolved in the faithfulness of God revealed through the successful appeal of the man Moses, who knew and reached the heart of God.</p></div>"

    "text" : "<div class=\"article\"><p><b><a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 35:4-Exod 39:43\">35:4–39:43</a></b> This entire section is based on <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 25-Exod 31\">chs. 25–31</a> but follows a different order. While <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 25-Exod 31\">chs. 25–31</a> gave the instructions for the tabernacle, this section describes its construction. Beginning with the reiteration of instructions for the gathering of offerings and artisans (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 35:4-Exod 35:19\">35:4–19</a>), the narrative then moves logically to the gathering of materials and the recognition of artisans (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 35:20-Exod 36:7\">35:20–36:7</a>), the construction of the tabernacle parts and contents (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 36:8-Exod 38:31\">36:8–38:31</a>), the preparation of sacred vestments (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 39:1-Exod 39:31\">39:1–31</a>), the erection of the tabernacle (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 39:32-Exod 40:33\">39:32–40:33</a>), and finally to the climactic arrival of the glory of the Lord in the tabernacle (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 40:34-Exod 40:38\">40:34–38</a>).</p></div>"
