In order to enjoy this blessing, however, they were to obey Him and keep His covenant. The revelation at Sinai manifested the holy character of the covenant God and defined the character and behavior appropriate for God’s covenant people.</p><p>The Sinai covenant also underscores the special role of the mediator. The Lord declared His intention to descend and speak directly to Moses so the people might hear and trust Moses forever (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 19:9\">19:9</a>). However, the face-to-face revelation so terrified the people that they pleaded with Moses to go up to God and receive the commands, then return and report to them (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 20:18-Exod 20:21\">20:18–21</a>).
