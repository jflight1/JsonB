The basic idea is that God is perfect life, while the essence of uncleanness is death. Normal, healthy creatures were clean, but abnormal or unhealthy creatures, and particularly corpses, were unclean. Abnormalities that suggested or that could lead to death were marks of uncleanness. Life and death were not to be mixed, so the unclean was never to enter God’s presence. Ultimately, it is Christ, the great Mediator and High Priest, who triumphs over death and corruption on behalf of those who trust in Him (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 15:20-1Cor 15:28\">1 Cor. 15:20–28</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 15:50-1Cor 15:57\">50–57</a>).</p></div>"

    "text" : "<div class=\"article\"><p><b><a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 11\">11:1–47</a></b> Moses instructs the Israelites regarding the principles of cleanness, showing them that, though all corpses are unclean (vv. 24, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 11:27\">27</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 11:31-Lev 11:40\">31–40</a>), some perfectly healthy creatures are also stated to be unclean in a milder sense and therefore must not be eaten. Although some of the forbidden animals posed a possible health threat (e.g., pigs as carriers of trichinosis), this classification is not based simply on health grounds. Rather, the principle teaches basic moral and spiritual truths. Carnivorous animals and birds of prey eat flesh with blood in it, something forbidden to human beings (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 7:26\">7:26</a>). Such animals also contact corpses, which are unclean. The clean creatures here symbolize Israelites, while unclean animals symbolize Gentiles. Only domesticated clean animals may be offered in sacrifice, for the sacrificial animal represents the offerer. In restricting his diet to clean animals, the Israelite was reminded that God had chosen Israel alone among the nations. Only when the new covenant admitted Gentiles to the community of God were the food laws abrogated (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Mark 7:19\">Mark 7:19</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Acts 10:15\">Acts 10:15</a>).</p></div>"

He is by nature majestic, awesome, and pure.

Israel’s holiness derived from her unique covenant relationship with the only true and living God. His covenant provided, among other things, moral and judicial laws that reflected God’s own righteous standards, and the sacrificial system to cleanse them from sin. The immediate background for this designation of Israel as a “holy nation” is the Lord’s appearance on Mount Sinai: they washed their clothes, avoided contact with the mountain, and abstained from sexual intercourse in preparation for that unique event (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 19:10-Exod 19:15\">Ex. 19:10–15</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 19:21-Exod 19:24\">21–24</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Heb 12:18-Heb 12:21\">Heb. 12:18–21</a>).</p><p>Jesus Christ, the Mediator of the new covenant (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Heb 8:6\">Heb. 8:6</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Heb 9:15\">9:15</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Heb 12:24\">12:24</a>), also demands perfection (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 5:48\">Matt. 5:48</a>). But He provides the new Israel with holiness by His perfect sacrifice, which removed the sins of His people forever (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Heb 9\">Heb. 9</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Heb 10\">10</a>), and by His Holy Spirit, who inscribes God’s moral law on their hearts (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Cor 3:3\">2 Cor. 3:3</a>; cf. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Jer 31:31-Jer 31:34\">Jer. 31:31–34</a>).
