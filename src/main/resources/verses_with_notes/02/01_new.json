The meaning is clear: the landowner is God, the vineyard is the kingdom of God (v. 43), the servants are the prophets, the son is Jesus, the tenants are the Jews who oppose Jesus, the killing of the son is the Crucifixion, and the removal of the tenants is the transferral of the kingdom to a new people of God that includes Gentiles.</p></div>"

Jesus claims to be the destroyer of earthly kingdoms, the founder of God’s kingdom on earth, and at the same time points out that the Jewish leaders are, as prophesied, opposed to this kingdom. Jesus’ quotation of <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ps 118\">Ps. 118</a> and the allusion to <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 8:14\">Is. 8:14</a> and <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Dan 2\">Dan. 2</a> provide the ground for the “stone” as a reference to Christ that appears frequently in the New Testament (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Acts 4:11\">Acts 4:11</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 9:33\">Rom. 9:33</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Pet 2:6-1Pet 2:8\">1 Pet. 2:6–8</a>).</p></div>"
