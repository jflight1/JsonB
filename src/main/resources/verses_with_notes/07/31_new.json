There must be charity toward the “weak” person whose conscience is still bound by scruples from which the gospel normally sets us free (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 15:2\">v. 2</a>).</p><p><b>quarrel over opinions.</b> In this instance, questions of food, drink, and the religious observation of days. While Paul does not regard these controversies as insoluble, he regards the unity of the church’s fellowship as more important than resolving them (cf. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 12:5\">12:5</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 12:10\">10</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 12:16\">16</a>). The issues in view here did not belong to the gospel, but to the relative strength or weakness of the individual’s faith in the gospel. Where essentials of the gospel were at stake, Paul’s response was very different (e.g., <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gal 1:6\">Gal. 1:6</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gal 1:7\">7</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gal 3:1-Gal 3:5\">3:1–5</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Phil 3:2\">Phil. 3:2</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Phil 3:18\">18</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Phil 3:19\">19</a>).</p></div>"

The temptation of the “weak” is to condemn the “strong” for behavior that seems to be lawless license. These mistaken responses should yield to the light of God’s gracious acceptance of both “weak” and “strong.” Furthermore, a fellow-believer is God’s servant, not ours, and is answerable to Him, not to us. It must be understood that the issues in such possible disputes are not matters of real morality, but of morally indifferent things.</p></div>"
