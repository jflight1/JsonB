While many of these no doubt resented the fact that Gentile Christians were not required to observe the ceremonial law of Moses (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Acts 21:25\">v. 25</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Acts 15:1-Acts 15:31\">15:1–31</a>), the charge here was that Paul was encouraging Jews to forsake the law as well (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Acts 15:21\">v. 21</a>). Such a charge may have been prompted by reports that Paul himself did not follow the Jewish ceremonial law when in Gentile company. Though Paul had no objection to Jews following their ancestral customs, he opposed any attempt to make such observance in some way necessary for salvation (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 14:1-Rom 14:8\">Rom. 14:1–8</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gal 5:2-Gal 5:6\">Gal. 5:2–6</a>). Always careful to avoid giving unnecessary offense, Paul’s flexibility in such matters shows that the interests of the gospel were always foremost in his mind (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 9:19-1Cor 9:23\">1 Cor. 9:19–23</a>).</p></div>"

Paul paid the expenses for four Nazirites, went to the priest with them for the sacrifices, and participated in the purification rites. In this way Paul publicly demonstrated that he was a law-abiding Jew.</p></div>"
