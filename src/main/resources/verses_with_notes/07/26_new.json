Having accounted for Jewish unbelief in terms of divine sovereignty, Paul now diagnoses it as due to a fatal prior commitment to a false way of righteousness. Divine sovereignty and the guilt of human willfulness are for Paul two aspects of reality. By God’s grace and sovereignty, Gentiles who did not seek God’s righteousness have now received it through faith in Christ, but Israel as a people have failed to receive it because they sought it by a legal means in which it could not be found. Christ has been to the Jews a stumbling stone (the image is from <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 8:14\">Is. 8:14</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 28:16\">28:16</a>) over which they have fallen (vv. 32, 33; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Pet 2:8\">1 Pet. 2:8</a>).</p></div>"

In particular, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Deut 30\">Deut. 30</a> sets this in the context of an anticipated return from exile-judgment (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Deut 30:1-Deut 30:6\">Deut. 30:1–6</a>).

Thus Christ was the end (goal) of the Mosaic law. To seek a self-established righteousness now is the equivalent of attempting to do what God alone could do and has done, in Christ’s incarnation and resurrection. By contrast with all human efforts, God has brought near the word of salvation, and with it salvation itself.
