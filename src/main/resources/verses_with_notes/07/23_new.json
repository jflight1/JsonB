Though the body is still subject to death, life prevails because those united with Christ live to God in the sphere of the Spirit. The duality in view here is not simply the distinction between the physical and spiritual sides of a believer’s life, but between two spheres of existence—bodily life in a fallen world with its ever present physical death, and life in the Spirit, a participation in the resurrection of Christ (1:4).</p></div>"

The passage itself emphasizes the Holy Spirit, His work, and His close association with Christ. The indwelling “Spirit of God” is called the “Spirit of Christ” (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 8:9\">v. 9</a>), and His indwelling is the means whereby “Christ is in you” (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 8:10\">v. 10</a>). Paul views this relationship as so close that he can even say “the Lord is the Spirit” (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Cor 3:17\">2 Cor. 3:17</a>; cf. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 15:45\">1 Cor. 15:45</a>). These passages do not take away the distinction between Christ and the Spirit as separate Persons of the Trinity. Rather, Paul teaches that Christ and the Holy Spirit work together in applying the resurrected life of Christ to the believer. The Spirit’s presence now is a guarantee of the future bodily resurrection of the believer (v. 11).</p></div>"

The glory to be revealed (v. 18) will appear as the sons of God are revealed in their new nature (v. 19), and the creation is liberated from its present state of imperfection and decay (vv. 20, 21). The revelation of this glory will more than wipe out all the harm and loss (“futility,” v. 20) that the created order has suffered as a result of Adam’s fall (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 3:17\">Gen. 3:17</a>).
