Abraham had nothing “to boast about,” for <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 15:6\">Gen. 15:6</a> proves that it was by faith, not by law-keeping, that he was counted righteous. James also points to Abraham as an example of one who demonstrates true faith by his works (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Jas 2:21\">James 2:21</a>).

Although faith was Abraham’s action, it contributed nothing to Abraham’s resultant righteousness before God, which was God’s own gift (v. 4). In this sense, while faith as the instrument of justification involves human activity, it is not a “work” of merit. The righteousness of God was “counted” to Abraham (vv. 3, 9) and not earned by him.

Even if he has shown that righteousness comes by grace through faith in the case of Abraham, has he forgotten that Abraham was the father of the circumcised (and therefore not of the uncircumcised)? The apostle provides a devastating answer: <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 15:6\">Gen. 15:6</a> describes Abraham before he was circumcised (v. 10). The righteousness signified and sealed for him by circumcision had already been credited to him when he was still uncircumcised. He serves as the prototype for all believers, both Jew and Gentile. For the Jew, he serves as prototype because his circumcision pointed back to his justification; for the Gentile, because he received justification apart from circumcision.</p></div>"
