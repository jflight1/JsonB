Although he specifically mentions Jews only at <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 2:17\">v. 17</a>, he probably has them in mind already. They agree with his statement about God’s wrath, but assume they stand outside of it (hence his stern warning in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 2:5\">v. 5</a>). But the nature of this presumption, if not its specific form, is not limited to Jews. In this context Paul sets forth the principles of the divine judgment all must face. It is based on truth (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 2:2\">v. 2</a>) and marked by righteousness (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 2:5\">v. 5</a>).

The Mosaic law already reveals God’s condemnation of sin, but the cause of sin lies in our hearts, that is, deeply rooted in our natures, and not in the law (7:13). The knowledge of “the work of the law” (v. 15) also resides in the heart, because mankind was created in the image of God (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 1:26\">Gen. 1:26</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 1:27\">27</a>).
