So great was his emphasis on the freeness of God’s grace in the face of sin that his preaching had been accused of antinomian tendencies, or ignoring the ethical requirements of the law (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 3:8\">3:8</a>). Now he makes the point that to continue in sin would involve a contradiction of the Christian’s new identity in Christ. In view of this new identity (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 3:11\">v. 11</a>), Christians are to refuse to allow sin to usurp authority in their lives, and instead are to yield the whole of life to God (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 3:12\">vv. 12</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 3:13\">13</a>) in the assurance that since they are under grace, not law, as the means of their salvation, sin is no longer their master.</p></div>"
