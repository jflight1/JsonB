(b) He is showing how God saves all the elect of Israel who are to be saved. (c) He is showing how God will, in the future, bring such widespread salvation to the Jewish people that, in an obvious general sense, it can be said that “all Israel will be saved” (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 11:26\">v. 26</a>). While not without difficulties, some form of this last view seems most likely for the following reasons. First, hints of it seem to appear already in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 11:11\">vv. 11</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 11:12\">12</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 11:15\">15</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 11:16\">16</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 11:24\">24</a>. Second, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 11:25\">v. 25</a> suggests that an end to the partial hardening of Israel is in view. Third, “Israel” in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 11:26\">v. 26</a> is not naturally interpreted as signifying a different entity from the Israel in view in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 11:1-Rom 11:24\">vv. 1–24</a> and <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 11:28-Rom 11:31\">vv. 28–31</a>, where national Israel (not spiritual Israel) is in view. Fourth, “mystery” in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 11:25\">v. 25</a> would seem inappropriate and exaggerated if Paul’s teaching were simply that all elect Jews will be saved. Finally, this view accords well with the quotations in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 11:26\">vv. 26</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 11:27\">27</a> from <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 59:20\">Is. 59:20</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 59:21\">21</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 27:9\">27:9</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Jer 31:33\">Jer. 31:33</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Jer 31:34\">34</a>, which appear to speak of a comprehensive banishment of that sin that has been the cause of Israel’s alienation from God.</p></div>"
