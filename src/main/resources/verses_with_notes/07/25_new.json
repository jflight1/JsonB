Paul recognizes that his previous statement cannot be allowed to pass without further comment. Could the distinguishing sovereign purpose of God throw into jeopardy His attribute of perfect righteousness? The idea is clearly unthinkable—“By no means!” (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 6:2\">6:2</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 6:15\">15</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 7:7\">7:7</a>). Paul explains why by citing two biblical texts (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 33:19\">Ex. 33:19</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 9:16\">9:16</a>) in vv. 15, 17, from which he concludes that God is righteous in showing mercy to some while He hardens the hearts of others. When God shows mercy it is not a person receiving a reward earned by one’s own efforts, but God’s sovereign free grace extended to persons who are morally incapable of any acceptable effort (1:18–3:20). God owes mercy to none, so there is no injustice when mercy is not shown. Mercy is a divine prerogative; it rests on God’s good pleasure. When God “hardens” Pharaoh’s heart (v. 18), He does not create fresh evil in it, but gives Pharaoh over to his already evil desires as an act of judgment, resulting eventually in God’s display of “power” (v. 22) in the destruction of Pharaoh’s army (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 14:17\">Ex. 14:17</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 14:18\">18</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 14:23-Exod 14:28\">23–28</a>).</p></div>"

It is unreasonable and irreverent for anyone to question the rightness of God’s ways. Potters have every right to do as they please with the clay (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 64:8\">Is. 64:8</a>). All belong to “the same lump” (cf. vv. 10–13) of fallen humanity in Adam (5:12–14); all actively sin even before God hardens them in sinning (1:18–28). That God should show mercy to any from the Adamic lump and create vessels of honor from it is the kindness of grace; that others should become vessels for lesser use is a matter of His sovereign prerogative and is itself a display of perfect justice towards them.</p></div>"

Paul does not elaborate on the preparation in view. The addition of “beforehand” in connection with the vessels of mercy may be pointing to the mercy that originates in God’s good pleasure from eternity (8:29, 30), while the wrath in view is in direct response to existing ungodliness and unrighteousness (cf. 1:18–32). The distinction between elect and reprobate does not lie in anything in themselves (all deserve wrath), but exclusively in the will of God. Within that context, however, the objects prepared for destruction experience wrath that is the only possible and just reward for sin.</p></div>"
