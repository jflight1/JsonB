While most of the kingship psalms focus on either divine or human kingship, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ps 2\">Ps. 2</a> masterfully integrates both, contrasting the divine King and His human counterpart with the hostile “kings of the earth.” The psalm has no title, but the New Testament ascribes it to David (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Acts 4:25\">Acts 4:25</a>). The New Testament frequently quotes and alludes to this psalm (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 3:17\">Matt. 3:17</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 17:5\">17:5</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Acts 4:25-Acts 4:27\">Acts 4:25–27</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Acts 13:33\">13:33</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 1:4\">Rom. 1:4</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Heb 1:5\">Heb. 1:5</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Heb 5:5\">5:5</a>).
