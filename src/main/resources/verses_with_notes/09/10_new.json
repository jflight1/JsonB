Titus had brought good news about the previous problems at Corinth, but a new problem demanded Paul’s attention. Paul was confident of the Corinthian church (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Cor 7:16\">7:16</a>), but not all the Corinthians were equally confident of Paul. Between <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Cor 9:12-2Cor 9:15\">9:12–15</a> and <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Cor 10:1\">10:1</a>, the tone changes abruptly from something positive to exasperation as Paul defends the genuineness of his calling as an apostle.

Yet he does not boast about his own knowledge or speaking skills or other abilities, but about how much he has suffered for the sake of Christ. Here Paul’s boasting is ironic—he “boasts” of things normally considered shameful, signs of weakness and defeats. Thus, his boasts are an imitation or parody of the boasting of his opponents, who praised themselves to the Corinthians in extravagant speeches. The topics in this section progress to a climax where Paul deals with what may have been uppermost in the minds of his critics—unusual religious experiences (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Cor 12:1-2Cor 12:9\">12:1–9</a>).</p></div>"

Apparently Paul’s Jewish opponents in Damascus persuaded the governor to cooperate in their plot against Paul. Although these two verses may seem somewhat surprising in the context, they mention Paul’s first—and rather humiliating—experience of being persecuted (rather than persecuting others) for the sake of the gospel. The apostle makes a precarious escape from a relatively minor civil authority, like a common fugitive. He is not presenting himself as a hero.</p></div>"
