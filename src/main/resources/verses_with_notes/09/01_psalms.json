There are no other examples in the Psalter. The closest parallels are the love poems found in the Song of Solomon. This song is appropriate for a royal wedding, and was probably used in many royal weddings throughout the history of Israel. Since the Davidic kingship reflects God’s ultimate kingship and anticipates Christ as King, the psalm has a second application to Christ, the King and Bridegroom, and the church as His bride (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Eph 5:25-Eph 5:32\">Eph. 5:25–32</a>). <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ps 45\">Ps. 45</a> is applied to Jesus Christ in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Heb 1:8\">Heb. 1:8</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Heb 1:9\">9</a>.</p></div>"
