While the letter to the Romans shows God as giving Gentiles over to a reckless and wanton life (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 1:24-Rom 1:31\">Rom. 1:24–31</a>), Ephesians presents the same progression from the human side: those who have turned aside “have given themselves up” (v. 19). Similarly in Exodus God is said to harden Pharaoh’s heart (e.g., <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 4:21\">Ex. 4:21</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 7:3\">7:3</a>), but Pharaoh also hardens his own heart (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 8:15\">Ex. 8:15</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 8:32\">32</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 9:34\">9:34</a>).</p></div>"
