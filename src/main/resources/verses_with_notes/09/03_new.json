The prohibition against being yoked together with unbelievers must be considered in situations where significant control over one’s actions would be willingly yielded to an unbeliever through a voluntary partnership or association. Neither Paul nor the rest of the New Testament tells us to have no association at all with unbelievers (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Mark 2:15-Mark 2:17\">Mark 2:15–17</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 5:9\">1 Cor. 5:9</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 5:10\">10</a>).
