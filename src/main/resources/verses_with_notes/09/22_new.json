Paul rejoices that God chooses people for a relationship with Himself (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 8:29-Rom 8:33\">Rom. 8:29–33</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 9:6-Rom 9:26\">9:6–26</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 11:5\">11:5</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 11:7\">7</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 11:28\">28</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 16:13\">16:13</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Col 3:12\">Col. 3:12</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Thess 1:4\">1 Thess. 1:4</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Thess 2:13\">2 Thess. 2:13</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Titus 1:1\">Titus 1:1</a>). Some suggest “in him” means God foresaw who would have faith in Christ and elected them. Not only does this add a thought that is not in the text, but elsewhere Paul teaches that the very state of being “in Christ” is something to which one is chosen (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 1:26-1Cor 1:31\">1 Cor. 1:26–31</a>). Paul says explicitly that the ground of God’s predestinating love is His own good pleasure (vv. 5, 10; cf. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Deut 7:7\">Deut. 7:7</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Deut 7:8\">8</a>), not anything we have done or will do (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 9:11\">Rom. 9:11</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 9:16\">16</a>). “In him” means that God’s choice always had in view a fallen people in union with their Redeemer (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Tim 1:9\">2 Tim. 1:9</a>). See also <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Pet 1:18-1Pet 1:21\">1 Pet. 1:18–21</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 13:8\">Rev. 13:8</a>.</p><p><b>holy and blameless.</b> See 5:27; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Col 1:22\">Col. 1:22</a>. God intends to bring His elect all the way from spiritual death in sin (2:1–5) to the forgiveness of sins in Christ (1:7), and finally to the elimination of all sin from their experience (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 8:29\">Rom. 8:29</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 8:30\">30</a>).</p><p><b>In love.</b> If “in love” belongs with the preceding phrase, it helps explain the nature of the holiness and blamelessness to which believers are called; this is consistent with the use of the phrase elsewhere in Ephesians (3:17; 4:2, 15, 16; 5:2). If it belongs with v. 5, the phrase explains predestination not simply as a matter of God’s decision, but as an act of His love (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Hos 11:1\">Hos. 11:1</a>). This understanding is probably better. It is consistent with 2:4, 5.</p></div>"

They also make two vital contributions to understanding Jesus’ resurrection and the status of believers. First, the same power that raised Jesus from the dead is at work in believers (2:4, 5; 3:16, 17). Second, Christ enjoys His position as head over everything for the sake of the church. Not only is Christ at the most exalted position in the universe, He is there representing believers (2:6; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Col 3:3\">Col. 3:3</a>) and governing the universe for their sake. The principles of conduct in Ephesians emphasize that authority exists for the sake of service. Jesus’ majestic use of power and authority in the interest of His people is the Christian’s model (4:1, 2, 7–13; 4:32–5:2, 22–33). Paul reminds his Gentile readers of two specific ways Christ’s power has blessed them: He brought them from death to life (2:1–10), and from alienation from God’s people to inclusion with them (2:11–22).</p></div>"
