The encouragement partially arises from their supernatural character (e.g., <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 41:21-Isa 41:27\">41:21–27</a>). These prophecies, delivered more than a century and a half beforehand (see Introduction: Interpretive Difficulties), astonish their audience by predicting Israel’s (i.e., Judah’s) immediate deliverance from Babylon by Cyrus (e.g., <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 44:24-Isa 45:13\">44:24–45:13</a>), the coming of the suffering Christ to save them from their sins after they return to the land (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 42:1-Isa 42:7\">42:1–7</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 49:1-Isa 49:13\">49:1–13</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 50:4-Isa 50:11\">50:4–11</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 52:13-Isa 53:12\">52:13–53:12</a>), and Israel’s final salvation in the last days (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 51:6\">51:6</a>). The near, more remote, and most remote prophecies merge together on the canvas. From Isaiah’s perspective, the restoration after the Exile inaugurates the new age, and this first taste of salvation through God’s servant, Cyrus, coalesces with the greater salvation that the Christ, God’s servant, will bring His people. Today, the elect have even more confidence in words of prophecy because these have been fulfilled in Christ and are being fulfilled in His Church (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Pet 1:19\">2 Pet. 1:19</a>).</p></div>"
