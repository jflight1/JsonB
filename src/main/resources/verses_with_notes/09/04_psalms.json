After the Fall (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 3\">Gen. 3</a>) sinful human beings lost their access to God. His holiness could not tolerate their unatoned sin. The patriarchs worshiped God at altars of sacrifice. After the Exodus, sacrifices were offered at the tabernacle and then at the temple appointed by God to be in Jerusalem. The whole city derived its sanctity from God’s house. Jesus Christ replaced the symbolism of the temple with the reality of His incarnation (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=John 1:14\">John 1:14</a>). Through His Spirit, the people of God are His temple (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 3:16\">1 Cor. 3:16</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 6:19\">6:19</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Eph 2:21\">Eph. 2:21</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Pet 2:5\">1 Pet. 2:5</a>).
