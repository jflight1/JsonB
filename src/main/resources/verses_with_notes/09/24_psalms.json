Some have found it so disconnected as to suggest that it was a collection of first lines of other poems. Yet there are common themes and attitudes in the psalm. It has a hymn-like mood of joy with frequent allusions to community worship. God appears as a warrior at its center. His victory over His enemies as expressed here became the background for Jesus’ victory over the forces of Satan at the Ascension (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Eph 4:7-Eph 4:13\">Eph. 4:7–13</a>).</p></div>"
