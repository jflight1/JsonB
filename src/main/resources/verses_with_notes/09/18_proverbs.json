There is evidence that the first part (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Prov 22:17-Prov 23:11\">22:17–23:11</a>) has drawn upon the Egyptian wisdom of Amenemope (cf. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Prov 4\">4:1–27</a> note). If so, these insights have been consciously appropriated as admonitions that assist one in meeting covenant obligations to “trust . . . in the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>” (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Prov 22:19\">22:19</a>). The author of Proverbs, like the historians of the Bible, was not prevented in principle from using existing materials in the course of writing what God inspired.</p></div>"
