Titus had brought good news about the previous problems at Corinth, but a new problem demanded Paul’s attention. Paul was confident of the Corinthian church (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Cor 7:16\">7:16</a>), but not all the Corinthians were equally confident of Paul. Between <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Cor 9:12-2Cor 9:15\">9:12–15</a> and <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Cor 10:1\">10:1</a>, the tone changes abruptly from something positive to exasperation as Paul defends the genuineness of his calling as an apostle.
