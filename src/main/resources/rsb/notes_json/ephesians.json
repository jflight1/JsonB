Some suggest “in him” means God foresaw who would have faith in Christ and elected them. Not only does this add a thought that is not in the text, but elsewhere Paul teaches that the very state of being “in Christ” is something to which one is chosen (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 1:26-1Cor 1:31\">1 Cor. 1:26–31</a>). Paul says explicitly that the ground of God’s predestinating love is His own good pleasure (vv. 5, 10; cf. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Deut 7:7\">Deut. 7:7</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Deut 7:8\">8</a>), not anything we have done or will do (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 9:11\">Rom. 9:11</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 9:16\">16</a>). “In him” means that God’s choice always had in view a fallen people in union with their Redeemer (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Tim 1:9\">2 Tim. 1:9</a>).

If it belongs with v. 5, the phrase explains predestination not simply as a matter of God’s decision, but as an act of His love (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Hos 11:1\">Hos. 11:1</a>).

They also make two vital contributions to understanding Jesus’ resurrection and the status of believers. First, the same power that raised Jesus from the dead is at work in believers (2:4, 5; 3:16, 17). Second, Christ enjoys His position as head over everything for the sake of the church. Not only is Christ at the most exalted position in the universe, He is there representing believers (2:6; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Col 3:3\">Col. 3:3</a>) and governing the universe for their sake. The principles of conduct in Ephesians emphasize that authority exists for the sake of service. Jesus’ majestic use of power and authority in the interest of His people is the Christian’s model (4:1, 2, 7–13; 4:32–5:2, 22–33).
