  "text" : "<div class=\"article\"><p><b><a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=John 1:1\">1:1</a></b> <b>the Word.</b> The term “Word” (Greek <i>logos</i>) designates God the Son with respect to His deity; “Jesus” and “Christ” refer to His incarnation and saving work. During the first three centuries, doctrines of the Person of Christ focused intensely on His position as the Logos. In Greek philosophy, the Logos was “reason” or “logic” as an abstract force that brought order and harmony to the universe. But in John’s writings such qualities of the Logos are gathered in the Person of Christ. In Neo-Platonic philosophy and the Gnostic heresy (second and third centuries <span class=\"small-caps\">a.d.</span>), the Logos was seen as one of many intermediate powers between God and the world. Such notions are far removed from the simplicity of John’s Gospel.</p><p>In this verse the Word is expressly affirmed to be God. The Word existed already “in the beginning” (a clear reference to the opening words of the Bible), which is a way of denoting the eternity that is unique to God. John states clearly, “the Word was God.” Some have observed that the word translated “God” here has no definite article, and argued on this basis that it means “a god” rather than “God.” This is a misunderstanding; the article is omitted because of the word order in the Greek sentence (the predicate “God” has been placed first for emphasis). The New Testament never endorses the idea of “a god,” an expression that implies polytheism and is in sharp conflict with the consistent monotheism of the Bible. In the New Testament, the Greek word for “God” occurs often without the definite article, depending on the requirements of Greek grammar.</p><p>That “the Word was with God,” indicates a distinction of Persons within the unity of the Godhead. Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are not successive forms of appearance of one Person, but are eternal Persons present from “the beginning” (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=John 1:2\">v. 2</a>). “With” suggests a relationship of close personal intimacy. See “One and Three: The Trinity” at <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 44:6\">Is. 44:6</a>.</p></div>"

The new birth, often called “regeneration,” is explained more fully in 3:1–21.

To some of John’s contemporaries, spirit and the divine were utterly opposed to matter and flesh. To others, the gods were thought to visit the earth disguised as human beings (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Acts 14:11\">Acts 14:11</a>). But here a chasm is bridged: the eternal Word of God did not merely appear to be a human being, but actually became flesh. He took to Himself a full and genuine human nature. See theological note “Jesus Christ, God and Man” on next page.</p><p><b>dwelt among us.</b> “Dwelt” means “pitched His tent.” This not only indicates the temporary nature of Jesus’ earthly existence, but does so in a way that recalls ancient Israel’s tabernacle, where God could be found (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 40:34\">Ex. 40:34</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 40:35\">35</a>).</p><p><b>we have seen his glory.</b> His “glory” is beheld, even as God’s was in the wilderness (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 16:1-Exod 16:10\">Ex. 16:1–10</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 33:18-Exod 33:23\">33:18–23</a>), in the tabernacle (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 40:34-Exod 40:35\">Ex. 40:34–35</a>), and later in the temple (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Kgs 8:1-1Kgs 8:11\">1 Kin. 8:1–11</a>). There may also be a reference to the Transfiguration, since John witnessed it (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 17:1-Matt 17:5\">Matt. 17:1–5</a>). “Glory” applies supremely to God, who is the Creator and Ruler of the universe, and before whom all knees must bow.

Understood literally, what Jesus said would be highly objectionable since it would involve cannibalism and a use of blood that was strictly forbidden in the Law (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 9:4\">Gen. 9:4</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 7:26\">Lev. 7:26</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 7:27\">27</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 17:10-Lev 17:14\">17:10–14</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Deut 12:23\">Deut. 12:23</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Deut 12:24\">24</a>). Jesus uses the language of eating and drinking to illustrate the intimacy of the union between Christ and the believer. This spiritual union, by which Christ imparts new life to the believer, is portrayed later in the Gospel as the union of a vine and its branches (15:1–8). It is sometimes called the “mystical union,” and is a recurrent topic in Paul’s letters (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gal 2:20\">Gal. 2:20</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Eph 1:3-Eph 1:14\">Eph. 1:3–14</a>).</p><p>Though some see here a reference to the Lord’s Supper, a mention of that sacrament at this point would have been incomprehensible to Jesus’ listeners. This passage is best understood as pointing to the spiritual reality the Lord’s Supper also signifies—union with Christ and all the benefits of salvation received through Him.</p></div>"

The other Gospels indicate that the Lord’s Supper was instituted on this occasion, but John does not say so, perhaps because he viewed the institution as sufficiently covered in the three Synoptic Gospels, Matthew, Mark, and Luke.</p><p>The relationship between the Synoptic accounts and John’s Gospel has been extensively discussed by many commentators. The Synoptic Gospels all state that the meal alluded to in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=John 13:2\">13:2</a> was the Passover meal (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 26:17-Matt 26:30\">Matt. 26:17–30</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Mark 14:12-Mark 14:26\">Mark 14:12–26</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Luke 22:7-Luke 22:23\">Luke 22:7–23</a>).

Matthew, Mark, and Luke refer to an additional phase before the Sanhedrin. Judging from the description of rules for trials found in the <i>Mishnah</i> of some two hundred years later, the proceedings here were marked by serious irregularities and violations of Jewish law. The Sanhedrin was not supposed to meet at night; the death penalty could not be declared on the day of the trial; there was false evidence, and false witnesses were used (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 26:59\">Matt. 26:59</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 26:60\">60</a>); Jesus was exposed to blows from attendants during the trial (v. 22; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Mark 14:65\">Mark 14:65</a>). In addition to all this, it was illegal for the Sanhedrin to meet for a capital case on the eve of a Sabbath or a feast day.

The Greek verb translated “love” in Jesus’ question changes when the question is raised the third time (v. 17), and Peter’s answer has this second verb each time. Some have thought that there is a difference intended in the use of the two verbs. This is possible but not necessary, for two reasons. First, John interchanges these verbs elsewhere in His Gospel. Second, other differences of wording in this conversation do not seem to indicate a difference of purpose. For example, “Feed my lambs,” “Tend my sheep,” and “Feed my sheep” are equivalent.</p><p><b>Feed my lambs.</b> “My lambs” and “my sheep” correspond to “my church” (10:14, 26, 27; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 16:18\">Matt. 16:18</a>). When Peter writes to his fellow elders (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Pet 5:1\">1 Pet. 5:1</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Pet 5:2\">2</a>), he urges them, “Shepherd the flock of God that is among you,” apparently having taken to heart the words of Jesus.</p></div>"
