Even Moses objected to the stringent preparations (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 19:23\">19:23</a>). The ceremonial law given at Sinai was the Lord’s gracious training of the people, a protective measure for a people unaccustomed to the holy presence of God (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 34\">Gen. 34</a> note).</p></div>"

Worshipers entered the outer court to pray and offer sacrifices; the priests carried the people’s petitions into the holy place; and once a year on the Day of Atonement the high priest entered the Most Holy Place, the very throne-room of the Almighty, with a blood atonement to meet the Lord at the mercy seat.</p><p>Nevertheless, the tabernacle was a provisional symbol, rather than the full reality, of God’s dwelling with man.
