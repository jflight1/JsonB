Under the Mosaic sacrificial system, forgiveness was offered through (but not on the basis of) animal sacrifice. As the New Testament recognizes (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Heb 9:11-Heb 9:15\">Heb. 9:11–15</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Heb 10:1-Heb 10:4\">10:1–4</a>), such sacrifices cannot substitute for the sins of humans. The real significance of the Old Testament sacrifices lay in the way they pointed forward to Christ through whom God would deal with human sin in an appropriate and final way. In view of what He would later do, God could righteously pass over “former sins” (v. 25). The work of Christ reveals both the justice of God (He does punish sin in the Person of His own Son, 8:32), and the righteousness of God’s way of salvation by “faith in Jesus” (v. 26). In dealing with Christ as sin-bearer and the human person as sinner, God does not compromise His own holiness, nor the necessity of sin’s being atoned for. Yet He graciously provides a salvation that mankind was incapable of obtaining. In this respect, Paul sees the Cross as the manifestation of the glorious wisdom of God (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 1:23\">1 Cor. 1:23</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 1:24\">24</a>).</p></div>"

Knowing the law, which promised life for obedience (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 6:10\">v. 10</a>), made Paul realize that law-keeping was required. Trying to obey it made him realize that inwardly, in the desires of his heart (especially coveting, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 6:8\">v. 8</a>, the sin forbidden in the tenth commandment), he was constantly breaking the law even before he knew it, and when he saw what he was doing he could not stop it. Thus, Paul writes that sin, the anti-God, anti-law driving force within him, “deceived me and . . . killed me” (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 6:11\">v. 11</a>). He became convinced that spiritually he was lifeless and lost. Paul offers his personal experience as an index of how sin and law relate in everyone.</p></div>"

A variety of interpretations exists, including the following: (a) Paul is describing the unregenerate person or perhaps the Jew in particular from the standpoint of the gospel; (b) Paul is describing a Christian in an unnatural and unhealthy spiritual condition, one failing to draw on the indwelling Spirit’s resources; (c) Paul is describing the transitional experience, possibly his own, of one who has been awakened to his true spiritual need, but has not yet entered a full experience of justification by faith; (d) Paul is describing himself and Christians generally who, although in Christ and free from the condemnation of the law, do not yet perfectly fulfill the requirements of the law. The last view is the most probable interpretation. It accounts for Paul’s shift to the present tense while his theme in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 7:7-Rom 7:25\">vv. 7–25</a> (God’s holy law stimulating and exposing sin) continues, and for the presence in Paul’s self-analysis here of elements found only in persons who have been united with the risen Christ to new life in the Spirit (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 6:4-Rom 6:11\">6:4–11</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 7:6\">7:6</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 8:4-Rom 8:9\">8:4–9</a>). Paul is aware that God’s law is “spiritual” (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 8:14\">v. 14</a>). He actually delights in God’s law, desiring to fulfill it perfectly (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 8:15-Rom 8:23\">vv. 15–23</a>), and he is distressed that sin in him opposes that desire. He is grateful at the prospect of future deliverance from this frustration (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 8:24\">v. 24</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 8:23\">8:23</a>). He distinguishes between his “mind,” which aims at obedience, and his “flesh,” which continues to sin (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 8:25\">v. 25</a>). All of these observations show that Paul is describing his experience as a new man in Christ.</p><p>Paul is actually describing a profound conflict that every Christian finds inherent in his life in Christ: Christ dwells in him (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gal 2:20\">Gal. 2:20</a>), yet sin also dwells in him (vv. 17, 20). Perfect conformity to God’s will is at present out of his reach. Salvation has “already” and “not yet” dimensions.</p><p>It is important to remember that Paul is still discussing the role of the law. He highlights the frustrations of the present Christian experience simply to show how, for Christians as for Jews, God’s good law provokes, exposes, and condemns sin without either being tainted by it or bringing deliverance from it.</p></div>"

The destiny appointed for believers (conformity to Christ and glorification with Him) flows from divine foreknowledge. Here it is persons, not facts or events, that God is said to foreknow. God does foresee events, but Paul’s point is that God has of His own initiative chosen the objects of His active, saving love. “Know” implies intimate personal relationship, not merely awareness of facts and circumstances (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 4:1\">Gen. 4:1</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Amos 3:2\">Amos 3:2</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 1:25\">Matt. 1:25</a>); it is virtually the equivalent of “elect.”</p></div>"

All who are predestined are called in this way. Predestination includes God’s determination that a person will receive such an effective call (that is, the “effectual call”). Predestination is not based on God’s knowing beforehand how people will respond to the gospel.

Paul recognizes that his previous statement cannot be allowed to pass without further comment. Could the distinguishing sovereign purpose of God throw into jeopardy His attribute of perfect righteousness? The idea is clearly unthinkable—“By no means!” (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 6:2\">6:2</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 6:15\">15</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 7:7\">7:7</a>). Paul explains why by citing two biblical texts (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 33:19\">Ex. 33:19</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 9:16\">9:16</a>) in vv. 15, 17, from which he concludes that God is righteous in showing mercy to some while He hardens the hearts of others. When God shows mercy it is not a person receiving a reward earned by one’s own efforts, but God’s sovereign free grace extended to persons who are morally incapable of any acceptable effort (1:18–3:20). God owes mercy to none, so there is no injustice when mercy is not shown. Mercy is a divine prerogative; it rests on God’s good pleasure. When God “hardens” Pharaoh’s heart (v. 18), He does not create fresh evil in it, but gives Pharaoh over to his already evil desires as an act of judgment, resulting eventually in God’s display of “power” (v. 22) in the destruction of Pharaoh’s army (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 14:17\">Ex. 14:17</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 14:18\">18</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 14:23-Exod 14:28\">23–28</a>).</p></div>"

In particular, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Deut 30\">Deut. 30</a> sets this in the context of an anticipated return from exile-judgment (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Deut 30:1-Deut 30:6\">Deut. 30:1–6</a>).

(b) He is showing how God saves all the elect of Israel who are to be saved. (c) He is showing how God will, in the future, bring such widespread salvation to the Jewish people that, in an obvious general sense, it can be said that “all Israel will be saved” (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 11:26\">v. 26</a>). While not without difficulties, some form of this last view seems most likely for the following reasons. First, hints of it seem to appear already in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 11:11\">vv. 11</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 11:12\">12</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 11:15\">15</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 11:16\">16</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 11:24\">24</a>. Second, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 11:25\">v. 25</a> suggests that an end to the partial hardening of Israel is in view. Third, “Israel” in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 11:26\">v. 26</a> is not naturally interpreted as signifying a different entity from the Israel in view in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 11:1-Rom 11:24\">vv. 1–24</a> and <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 11:28-Rom 11:31\">vv. 28–31</a>, where national Israel (not spiritual Israel) is in view. Fourth, “mystery” in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 11:25\">v. 25</a> would seem inappropriate and exaggerated if Paul’s teaching were simply that all elect Jews will be saved. Finally, this view accords well with the quotations in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 11:26\">vv. 26</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rom 11:27\">27</a> from <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 59:20\">Is. 59:20</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 59:21\">21</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 27:9\">27:9</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Jer 31:33\">Jer. 31:33</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Jer 31:34\">34</a>, which appear to speak of a comprehensive banishment of that sin that has been the cause of Israel’s alienation from God.</p></div>"
