He anticipates, however, that those with uncircumcised hearts and ears will raise questions denying these truths, and will seek to establish a righteousness of their own (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Deut 6:12\">vv. 12</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Deut 6:13\">13</a>).
