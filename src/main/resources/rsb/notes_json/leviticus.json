The laws are subdivided into sections addressed to the laity (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 1:1-Lev 6:7\">1:1–6:7</a>) and to the priests (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 6:8-Lev 7:38\">6:8–7:38</a>). Sacrifice in Israel involved the offering of selected domestic animals, grain, oil, and wine. All these products symbolized the worshiping Israelite, who, through the act of sacrifice, was giving himself back to God in some way. In every animal offering the worshiper placed his hand on the victim’s head, thereby identifying himself with the animal, saying in effect, “This animal represents me.” The animal sacrifices involved the animal’s death, and so the sacrifices had atoning symbolism: the animal dying in the sinful worshiper’s place represented redemption from the death he deserved. There is then a common core of meaning and significance shared by all the sacrifices. But each sacrifice also had its own distinctive ritual features and religious emphases. This is indicated by the different names of the sacrifices, which sometimes highlight the ritual distinctiveness (“<i>burnt</i> offering,”) and sometimes the theologically distinctive feature (“<i>peace</i> offering, <i>guilt</i> offering”).</p><p>Although the Lord, in response to Moses’ intercession (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 32\">Ex. 32</a>), had rescinded His verdict to judge the people for their idolatrous worship of the golden calf, the removal of their sin remained an unresolved problem. These sacrifices provided an atonement for them and for Aaron, their priest, who led them into that sin (ch. 9). In contrast to Aaron, Jesus Christ, the High Priest of the new Israel, is without sin and never tempts His people to sin (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Heb 9:6-Heb 9:15\">Heb. 9:6–15</a>).</p></div>"

While all sacrifices make atonement for sin to some extent, atonement is the dominant concern of the sin offering. Sin and uncleanness make a person unfit to be in God’s presence and also pollute the sanctuary, making it impossible for God to dwell there. The sin offering is designed to cope with this aspect of sin by purifying both the sinner and the sanctuary. The distinctive feature of the sin offering is the use to which the sacrificial blood is put. In other sacrifices the animal’s blood is splashed over the side of the altar, but in the case of the sin offering it could be applied to the horned corners of the altar, or sprinkled inside the tabernacle tent (on the incense altar or veil), or even inside the Most Holy Place. Because the tabernacle and its furniture were closely associated with the people who met God there (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Heb 9:22\">Heb. 9:22</a> note), the people’s sin defiled the tabernacle as well as themselves.

The basic idea is that God is perfect life, while the essence of uncleanness is death. Normal, healthy creatures were clean, but abnormal or unhealthy creatures, and particularly corpses, were unclean. Abnormalities that suggested or that could lead to death were marks of uncleanness. Life and death were not to be mixed, so the unclean was never to enter God’s presence. Ultimately, it is Christ, the great Mediator and High Priest, who triumphs over death and corruption on behalf of those who trust in Him (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 15:20-1Cor 15:28\">1 Cor. 15:20–28</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Cor 15:50-1Cor 15:57\">50–57</a>).</p></div>"

Although some of the forbidden animals posed a possible health threat (e.g., pigs as carriers of trichinosis), this classification is not based simply on health grounds. Rather, the principle teaches basic moral and spiritual truths. Carnivorous animals and birds of prey eat flesh with blood in it, something forbidden to human beings (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 7:26\">7:26</a>). Such animals also contact corpses, which are unclean. The clean creatures here symbolize Israelites, while unclean animals symbolize Gentiles. Only domesticated clean animals may be offered in sacrifice, for the sacrificial animal represents the offerer. In restricting his diet to clean animals, the Israelite was reminded that God had chosen Israel alone among the nations.

Modern physicians recognize here the symptoms of various modern complaints, but we should remember that the biblical classification is based primarily on spiritual rather than hygienic or medical considerations. The key principle in identifying a skin disease as “unclean” was whether the skin seemed to be rotting away, suggesting the spiritual principle of death. Patchy complaints amounted to uncleanness (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 13:9\">vv. 9</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 13:10\">10</a>), but a complaint affecting the whole body did not (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 13:12\">vv. 12</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 13:13\">13</a>).

It fell in the Hebrew seventh month (October) and involved the offering of various sacrifices, the entry of the high priest into the Most Holy Place (in this chapter referred to simply as the “Holy Place” or “holy sanctuary”), and the dispatch of a goat into the wilderness carrying the people’s sins. For a summary of the sacrifices see notes on <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 1\">chs. 1</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 4\">4</a>; and <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 5\">5</a>. A summary of the rites is given in vv. 6–10 and fuller details in vv. 11–28. The Day of Atonement proceeded according to the following steps: (a) The high priest washed and dressed (v. 4); (b) he sacrificed a bull as a sin offering for himself (v. 6; cf. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 5:11\">v. 11</a>); (c) he entered the Most Holy Place and sprinkled the ark with blood (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 5:12-Lev 5:14\">vv. 12–14</a>); (d) he took two goats and by lot chose one to be the scapegoat (Azazel), the other to be a sin offering (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 5:7-Lev 5:8\">vv. 7–8</a>); (e) he sacrificed one goat as a sin offering (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 5:9\">vv. 9</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 5:15\">15</a>); (f) he entered the Most Holy Place and sprinkled the ark with blood (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 5:15\">v. 15</a>); (g) he went out to the outer part of the tabernacle of meeting and sprinkled the blood (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 5:16\">v. 16</a>); (h) he went out into the courtyard of the tabernacle and sprinkled the main altar with blood (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 5:18-Lev 5:19\">vv. 18–19</a>); (i) he confessed the sins of the Israelites as he laid his hands on the scapegoat’s head (v. 21); (j) he sent the scapegoat into the wilderness (vv. 21–22); (k) the scapegoat gone, the high priest changed into his regular garments and washed (vv. 23–24); and (l) finally, he offered burnt offerings for himself and for the people (vv. 24–25).</p><p>For the high priest, the most important aspects of the ceremony were his entry into the Most Holy Place with the blood of the sin offerings and the dispatch of the scapegoat into the wilderness. These actions atoned for the sins of repentant Israelites (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 5:16\">vv. 16</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 5:19\">19</a>, 21–22). All sin offerings served to cleanse both the earthly sanctuary and the worshipers, but on other occasions the high priest did not enter the (inner) Most Holy Place, but only the anteroom before the separating veil (usually called the “Holy Place”), the chamber containing the altar of incense, the gold lampstand, and the table of showbread. Because the ark of the covenant, the focal point of God’s presence in the tabernacle (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 5:2\">v. 2</a> note; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Exod 25:17-Exod 25:22\">Ex. 25:17–22</a> and notes), was housed in the Most Holy Place, entry to the Most Holy Place was rare and dangerous (v. 2). That the high priest entered the inner chamber only on this one day of the year indicated the depth of atonement being made.</p><p>The scapegoat ceremony was also unique to this day. By placing his hands on the goat’s head and confessing the nation’s sins, the high priest transferred those sins to the goat. The goat then symbolically carried the people’s sins away into the wilderness. Christians have long regarded the scapegoat as a type of Christ. The New Testament makes many comparisons between the Day of Atonement and the death of Christ (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Heb 9:6-Heb 9:28\">Heb. 9:6–28</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Heb 13:11-Heb 13:13\">13:11–13</a>).

Life is sacred because it belongs to God. As a mark of respect for life and for its Creator, no Israelite could eat meat with blood in it “for the life of the flesh is in the blood” (cf. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Gen 9:4-Gen 9:6\">Gen. 9:4–6</a>). A second reason is that it is the blood that makes “atonement for your souls.” The blood of animals shed in sacrifice took the place of, and symbolically redeemed, the life of the worshiper. Because animal blood was the sign of salvation, man must not consume it. These ideas are both assumed and transformed in the New Testament. Christ’s shed blood actually atoned for sin (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Heb 9:14\">Heb. 9:14</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Heb 9:22\">22</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1John 1:7\">1 John 1:7</a>), and those who spiritually drink that blood have eternal life (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=John 6:54\">John 6:54</a>).</p><p><b>have given it for you.</b> The sacrificial system of the Old Testament was God’s gracious gift to His people.
