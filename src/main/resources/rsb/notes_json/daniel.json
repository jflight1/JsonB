The prayer has four parts: (a) worship (v. 4); (b) a confession of sin (vv. 5–11); (c) recognition of the justice of God in His judgment on sin (vv. 11–14); and (d) a plea for God’s mercy based on concern for His name, kingdom, and will (vv. 15–19). The prayer is grounded on God’s promises (v. 2) and offered in a spirit of contrition and humility (v. 3). It is a model for the appropriate elements of effective prayer.</p></div>"

In the symbolic view the seventy years of punishment (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Dan 9:2\">v. 2</a>) are multiplied seven times in accordance with the covenantal curses (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 26:18\">Lev. 26:18</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 26:21\">21</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 26:24\">24</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Lev 26:28\">28</a>). <i>Jubilees,</i> a Jewish book from the period between the Testaments, also structures the whole of history into periods of 490 years. Adherents of the literal view fall into three categories. As with other prophecies in Daniel, some commentators interpret the verses with reference to the time of Antiochus IV. Other interpreters may be divided into two groups: (a) those who interpret the passage as having its primary focus on events associated with the First Advent of Christ and shortly thereafter (first-advent view); (b) those who interpret the passage as having reference to events associated with both the first and second advents of Christ with an unstated time interval between the two (second-advent view).

For this reason some interpreters understand these verses to describe the Antichrist, who like Antiochus IV will persecute God’s people just prior to the Second Advent of Christ (cf. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Dan 12:1-Dan 12:3\">12:1–3</a>). These verses describe the character of the Antichrist, his activities, and the destiny of God’s people. This understanding requires a time interval between the events depicted in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Dan 11:21-Dan 11:35\">11:21–35</a> and those in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Dan 11:36-Dan 12:3\">11:36–12:3</a>. Consequently, other interpreters have understood vv. 36–39 as a summary of Antiochus’s religious policies; vv. 40–45 as a description of how his ambition leads to his defeat; and <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Dan 12:1-Dan 12:3\">12:1–3</a> as an anticipation of his defeat. The anticipated invasion of the Holy Land may be presented as a parallel to Nebuchadnezzar’s earlier invasion, using the names of the nations of that time, sparing Israel’s old enemies (v. 41), and climaxing in the anticipated defeat of Egypt itself (vv. 42, 43; cf. <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Ezek 29\">Ezek. 29</a>). At his proudest moment Antiochus is destroyed at Mount Zion in the heart of the Holy Land (vv. 44, 45). Antiochus’s defeat in 12:1–3 is described in terms of the absolute end of history. Because the prophecies in 11:40–12:3 have not been fulfilled historically, it is difficult to discern how literal or metaphorical they are, and their interpretation must be speculative. The interpretation that the future Antichrist is in view will be followed in the remaining notes.</p></div>"
