It is the classic statement of the ethics of the kingdom of God. The early church favored a literal interpretation but fully applied the sermon only to special classes of Christians, especially monastics. Others, such as the Anabaptists, have attempted to apply it literally to every Christian. Still others have viewed it as legalistic, as a provisional, temporary code, or as a heightening of the law of Moses with the aim of inducing repentance (Luther). Finally, some have argued that the demands of the sermon are not to be understood literally, but that Jesus was concerned with inward disposition rather than outward conduct, or that the severity of the sermon is intended to compel a decision by the hearers either for or against God’s demands on their lives.</p><p>We must recognize that the sermon is directed to the disciples and through them to the whole church today. The sermon addresses both inward motives and outward conduct (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 5:21\">5:21</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 5:22\">22</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 5:27\">27</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 5:28\">28</a>). These legitimate demands are so strict (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 5:48\">5:48</a>) that no one can completely obey them, and we are therefore driven to the grace and mercy of God. In some cases Jesus uses obviously intentional exaggeration to illustrate the absolute requirements of God’s law (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 5:29\">5:29</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 5:30\">30</a>).</p></div>"

The chief difficulty is that the note of urgency in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 16:23\">v. 23</a> seems incompatible with a delay until the Last Judgment.</p><p>(b) The “coming” is the resurrection and ascension of Jesus or the sending of the Spirit at Pentecost. However, there is no evidence that the disciples were persecuted with the intensity assumed in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 16:17-Matt 16:22\">vv. 17–22</a> prior to Jesus’ resurrection or Pentecost.</p><p>(c) The phrase “before the Son of Man comes” is a way of saying, “before I rejoin you.” But again the persecution described in <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Matt 16:17-Matt 16:22\">vv. 17–22</a> did not occur during this time, and the purpose for the coming of the Son of Man elsewhere (to bring judgment) makes this meaning unlikely.</p><p>(d) The “coming” refers to the destruction of Jerusalem in <span class=\"small-caps\">a.d.</span> 70 as an act of judgment against the nation of Israel. This understanding retains the note of urgency and fits the experience of the church prior to <span class=\"small-caps\">a.d.</span> 70. The other references to the coming of the Son of Man view it as a great and terrible display of God’s judgment.

Though some argue that Matthew softens the note of divine sovereignty seen in Mark, the word “lest” in v. 15 indicates that God’s sovereign choice lies behind the hardening of their hearts whether it precedes (Matthew) or follows (Mark) an encounter with Jesus’ teaching. While in this passage Matthew highlights the moral responsibility of those who reject Christ, his inclusion of the reference to <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 6:9\">Is. 6:9</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Isa 6:10\">10</a> illustrates the compatibility of God’s sovereignty and human responsibility. The parables served as an instrument of judgment by hardening the impenitent.</p></div>"

But this linguistic difference is not significant for this context. The second possibility is unlikely because Jesus describes Himself in this passage as not the foundation but the builder of the church.</p><p>If it had not been for the abuse of this passage by the Roman Catholic Church, it is unlikely that any doubt would have arisen that the reference is to Peter. But the foundational rock is Peter as a representative apostle (v. 15 note) whose confession of Christ has been revealed to him by the Father. As Peter himself later declares (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=1Pet 2:4-1Pet 2:8\">1 Pet. 2:4–8</a>), all believers have become “living stones” by virtue of their association with Christ, with the apostles as the foundation (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Eph 2:20\">Eph. 2:20</a>, <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Eph 2:21\">21</a>; <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=Rev 21:14\">Rev. 21:14</a>).

God’s servants have the task of offering the gospel to all people (v. 9).

The identity of Zechariah is problematic, and all suggested solutions have difficulties. Zechariah the prophet was the “son of Barachiah,” but there is no evidence that he was martyred. There was a Zechariah, son of Baruch, who was killed by Zealots as mentioned by Josephus (<i>Jewish Wars</i> 4:334–44). He was killed in the temple area, but probably not between the sanctuary and the altar. Zechariah, son of Jehoiada, is the last martyr mentioned in the Old Testament in the Hebrew canonical order (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Chr 24:20-2Chr 24:22\">2 Chr. 24:20–22</a>).

If not for the words “son of Barachiah,” the Zechariah of <a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"/passage/?search=2Chr 24\">2 Chr. 24</a> would be most likely, since Abel and Zechariah are the first and last martyrs in the Hebrew canon.
