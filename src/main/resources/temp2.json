The genealogy begins with Perez, someone who could \u201cbreach\u201d (<a class=\"bibleref\" href=\"\/passage\/?search=Gen 38:29\">Gen. 38:29<\/a>, text note), and whom the women in their blessing remembered as the vigorous son of Tamar (v. 12). Like Ruth, Tamar became an ancestor of David in an unexpected way. For New Testament readers, David is not the end of God\u2019s provisions for the people of His choice, His covenant bride. But for her own time, Ruth\u2019s journey had reached its divinely appointed goal.<\/p><\/div>",
